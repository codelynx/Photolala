# Photolala2 Project Status

## Current Branch: `feature/photo-basket`

## Photo Basket Feature - Phase 1 Complete ✅

### Completed Components (Phase 1 - Foundation)

#### Core Models
- **BasketItem.swift**: Data model with source tracking and security-scoped bookmarks
  - Sandbox detection for bookmark operations
  - Proper security scope handling for iOS/macOS

#### Services
- **PhotoBasket.swift**: Singleton service managing basket operations
  - No maximum item limit (supports 100K+ items for deep archive retrieval)
  - Creates security-scoped bookmarks when adding items
  - Persistence support (currently disabled)

#### Photo Sources
- **BasketPhotoProvider.swift**: PhotoSourceProtocol implementation for basket
  - Item-specific source resolution with proper context
  - Source verification to ensure items exist
  - Error propagation for failed source resolution
  - Security scope lifetime management

#### UI Components
- **BasketBadgeView.swift**: Toolbar badge with count and animations
- **PhotoBasketHostView.swift**: Main basket view using PhotoBrowserView
- **BasketAddButton**: Button component for adding items to basket

### Critical Fixes Applied
1. ✅ Security-scoped bookmarks only used in sandboxed environments
2. ✅ LocalPhotoSource properly manages security scope lifetime
3. ✅ Source resolution verifies item existence and propagates errors

## Next: Phase 2 - UI Integration

### Planned Components
- Add basket button to photo browser cells
- Keyboard shortcuts (B to add, ⌘B to open basket)
- Bulk selection support
- Visual feedback for items in basket

### Phase 3 - Batch Actions (Future)
- Star/unstar operations
- Album creation and management
- Deep archive retrieval
- Export functionality

## Technical Decisions
- Using dependency injection via PhotoBrowserEnvironment
- Following PhotoSourceProtocol for consistency
- Security-scoped bookmarks for cross-session access
- Item-specific source resolution for reliability
