# Google Photos Browser Implementation - Phase 1 Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the foundation for Google Photos browser on Android, following the same architecture pattern as the iOS Apple Photos Library browser.

## Completed Components

### 1. **Google Photos API Dependency**
- Added `com.google.photos.library:google-photos-library-client:1.7.3` to build.gradle
- Configured packaging exclusions for META-INF conflicts

### 2. **Google Sign-In Integration**
- Added Google Photos scope to `GoogleSignInLegacyService`
- Scope: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/photoslibrary.readonly`
- Methods for checking and requesting Photos access

### 3. **Photo Model**
- Created `PhotoGooglePhotos` implementing `PhotoItem` interface
- Uses stable `mediaItemId` as identifier (like PHAsset.localIdentifier on iOS)
- Prefix: `ggp#` for Google Photos (like `gap#` for Apple Photos)
- Supports temporary URL handling with expiration detection

### 4. **Service Layer**
- `GooglePhotosService` interface defining API operations
- `GooglePhotosServiceImpl` with stub implementation
- Ready for actual API integration in Phase 2

### 5. **ViewModel**
- `GooglePhotosProvider` ViewModel following same pattern as PhotoGridViewModel
- Manages photos, albums, selection, tags, and authorization state
- URL cache management for handling expiring URLs

### 6. **UI Components**
- `GooglePhotosScreen` composable similar to PhotoGridScreen
- Album picker dialog
- Selection mode with tag/star support
- Authorization and error states

### 7. **Navigation Integration**
- Added `GooglePhotos` route to navigation
- Added Google Photos button to WelcomeScreen
- Button enabled when user has Google account linked

## Architecture Consistency

The implementation maintains consistency with iOS patterns:
- Photo source abstraction (PhotoItem interface)
- Provider/ViewModel pattern
- Selection and tag management
- Backup queue integration
- Grid view customization options

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

1. **Implement actual Google Photos API calls**
   - OAuth2 credential management
   - PhotosLibraryClient initialization
   - Convert protobuf responses to data models

2. **URL refresh mechanism**
   - Implement automatic URL refresh when expired
   - Background refresh for visible items

3. **Photo viewer integration**
   - Navigate to PhotoViewer for Google Photos
   - Full resolution image loading

4. **Download functionality**
   - Implement photo download to device
   - MD5 calculation for downloaded photos

## Known Limitations

1. Google Photos API doesn't provide:
   - File size information
   - Direct photo count
   - MD5 hashes (must download to calculate)

2. Temporary URLs expire after ~60 minutes
3. API rate limits apply

## Testing Notes

- Requires Google account with Photos access
- User must grant Photos permission during sign-in
- Test with various album sizes and photo types
- Verify URL refresh mechanism under long sessions
