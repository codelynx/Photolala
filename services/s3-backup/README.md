## Status

ðŸš§ **Design Phase** - Currently documenting requirements and architecture

## Goals

1. Provide automatic backup of local photos to S3-compatible storage
2. Support multiple S3 providers (AWS S3, Backblaze B2, Wasabi, MinIO, etc.)
3. Enable selective sync and smart caching
4. Maintain photo metadata and folder structure
5. Ensure secure and efficient transfers

## Non-Goals (Phase 1)
