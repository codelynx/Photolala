# Documentation Review and Updates

Last Updated: January 17, 2025

## Overview

This session focused on three main areas:
1. IAP Developer Tools consolidation and bug fixes
2. Local receipt validation implementation 
3. Usage tracking and CloudWatch monitoring design

## Changes Made

### 1. IAP Developer Tools Consolidation

**Problem**: Duplicate IAP testing views and window sizing issues

**Solution**: Created consolidated `IAPDeveloperView.swift` with proper window management

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `Photolala/Views/IAPDeveloperView.swift` - New consolidated developer view
- `Photolala/Commands/PhotolalaCommands.swift` - Reorganized menu structure

**Key Improvements**:
- Fixed TabView bug causing title bar issues by using Picker + switch
- Proper window sizing (1000x700) with title configuration
- Consolidated IAP Testing and Debug Panel into single interface
- Created new "Photolala" menu to avoid duplicate View menus

### 2. Local Receipt Validation

**Implementation**: StoreKit 2 based local validation for development

**Files Created**:
- `Photolala/Services/LocalReceiptValidator.swift` - Receipt validation service
- `Photolala/Views/ReceiptValidationTestView.swift` - Testing interface
- `docs/planning/local-receipt-validation-implementation.md` - Implementation guide

**Features**:
- Uses `Transaction.currentEntitlements` for validation
- Supports both StoreKit 2 and sandbox validation
- Development-only implementation (#if DEBUG)
- No server-side validation needed for MVP

### 3. Usage Tracking Design

**Approach**: Client-side usage calculation using AWS SDK for Swift

**Documentation Created**:
- `docs/planning/usage-tracking-feature.md` - Feature design document
- `services/s3-backup/design/usage-tracking-design.md` - Technical design
- `services/s3-backup/implementation/usage-tracking-mvp.md` - MVP implementation plan

**Files Created** (partial implementation):
- `Photolala/Models/StorageUsage.swift` - Usage data model
- `Photolala/Services/UsageTrackingService.swift` - Usage tracking service

**Key Decisions**:
- No Lambda/backend required for MVP
- Use S3 ListObjectsV2 API directly from iOS
- 24-hour local caching
- Soft limits with 10% grace period

### 4. CloudWatch Monitoring

**Documentation Created**:
- `services/s3-backup/implementation/cloudwatch-monitoring.md` - Monitoring design
- `services/s3-backup/implementation/monitoring-setup-checklist.md` - Setup guide

**Key Points**:
- No scripts required - all setup via AWS Console
- Basic alarms: cost, storage size, request rate
- ~35 minutes manual setup time
- Cost: ~$10-50/month for monitoring

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Client-Side Usage Tracking
- **Rationale**: Simpler than backend services, uses existing S3 credentials
- **Trade-offs**: Slower for large libraries, but acceptable with caching
- **Future**: Can add server-side tracking later if needed

### 2. Local Receipt Validation
- **Rationale**: Sufficient for development and TestFlight testing
- **Security**: StoreKit 2 provides cryptographic verification
- **Production**: Will need server-side validation for App Store release

### 3. Manual CloudWatch Setup
- **Rationale**: Avoid complexity of Infrastructure as Code for MVP
- **Benefits**: Quick to implement, easy to modify
- **Future**: Can automate with CloudFormation/Terraform later

## Technical Discoveries

### TabView Bug on macOS
- TabView with `.tabViewStyle(.automatic)` pushes content into title bar
- Solution: Use Picker with switch statement instead
- Filed as potential SwiftUI bug

### StoreKit 2 Advantages
- Built-in receipt validation with `Transaction.currentEntitlements`
- No need for ASN.1 parsing or certificate validation
- Async/await support throughout

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Before Launch)
1. Complete usage tracking UI implementation
2. Integrate usage checks with upload flow
3. Set up CloudWatch monitoring in AWS Console
4. Test with large photo libraries

### Post-Launch
1. Monitor usage patterns and costs
2. Implement server-side receipt validation
3. Add usage history and trends
4. Consider automated enforcement

## Lessons Learned

1. **Start Simple**: Client-side solutions can be sufficient for MVP
2. **SwiftUI Quirks**: Some macOS-specific bugs require workarounds
3. **AWS Services**: Many features available without custom backend
4. **Documentation First**: Planning before coding saves time

## Files to Add to Xcode Project

The following files were created but need to be added to the Xcode project:
- `Photolala/Views/IAPDeveloperView.swift` - Consolidated IAP developer tools
- `Photolala/Services/LocalReceiptValidator.swift` - Local receipt validation
- `Photolala/Views/ReceiptValidationTestView.swift` - Receipt validation UI
- `Photolala/Models/StorageUsage.swift` - Storage usage data model
- `Photolala/Services/UsageTrackingService.swift` - Usage tracking service

Note: These files should be added to the appropriate groups in Xcode and included in the app target.

## Repository Status

Current branch: `feature/s3-backup-service`

Ready for:
- Usage tracking UI implementation
- CloudWatch monitoring setup
- Testing with TestFlight
