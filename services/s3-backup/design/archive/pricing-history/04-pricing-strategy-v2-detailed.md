# Photolala S3 Backup - Pricing Strategy V2 (Detailed)

## Key Insights
- Users have local copies, so ultra-short hot windows are acceptable
- Three data types with different access patterns
- Apple takes 30% commission on IAP
- Target 20% profit margin (flexible)

## Data Types & Storage Strategy

### 1. Photo Data (95% of storage)
- **Days 0-2**: S3 Standard (instant access) - $0.023/GB
- **Days 3+**: S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval - $0.004/GB
  - Note: Using Glacier Instant (not Deep Archive)
  - Allows millisecond retrieval when needed
  - Better UX than Deep Archive ($0.00099/GB with 12-48hr retrieval)
- Users rarely need instant access to old photos (they have local copies)

### 2. Thumbnails (4% of storage)
- **Days 0-7**: S3 Standard ($0.023/GB)
- **Days 8+**: S3 Standard-IA ($0.0125/GB)
- Always accessible for browsing

### 3. Metadata (1% of storage)
- **Always**: S3 Standard-IA ($0.0125/GB)
- Critical for app functionality

**Note**: We specifically chose Glacier Instant Retrieval (not Deep Archive) to maintain good UX with millisecond retrieval times.

## Key Advantages

1. **Ultra-Low Photo Storage Cost**: $0.004/GB with Glacier Instant
2. **Smart Tiering**: Different lifecycle for each data type
3. **Browsable Always**: Thumbnails stay accessible
4. **Profitable**: 20% margin after Apple's cut
5. **Competitive**: Still 5-10x more storage than competitors

## Implementation Notes

1. Set lifecycle rules per data type
2. Store thumbnails with prefix: `thumbs/`
3. Store metadata with prefix: `meta/`
4. Monitor usage patterns to optimize hot windows
5. Consider annual plans for better margins
