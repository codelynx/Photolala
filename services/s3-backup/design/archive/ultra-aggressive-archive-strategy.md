# Ultra-Aggressive Archive Strategy

## 1-Month Archive Analysis

### For 500GB at $1.99

```
AWS Costs (1-month archive):
- 10GB STANDARD: 10 × $0.023 = $0.23
- 490GB DEEP_ARCHIVE: 490 × $0.00099 = $0.49
- Thumbnails (2.5GB): 2.5 × $0.023 = $0.06
- Overhead: $0.15
Total: $0.93 (33% margin) ✅
```

Wait... same cost? Let's dig deeper:

### Actually, STANDARD vs STANDARD_IA

```
Option A: STANDARD_IA (current)
- 20GB STANDARD_IA: 20 × $0.0125 = $0.25
- 480GB DEEP_ARCHIVE: 480 × $0.00099 = $0.48

Option B: STANDARD (your idea)
- 10GB STANDARD: 10 × $0.023 = $0.23
- 490GB DEEP_ARCHIVE: 490 × $0.00099 = $0.49

Difference: Only $0.02 more!
```

## But Here's the HUGE Benefit

### STANDARD = No Retrieval Fees!
```
STANDARD_IA: $0.01/GB retrieval fee
STANDARD: $0.00 retrieval fee

User downloads 10GB of recent photos:
- STANDARD_IA: $0.10 retrieval cost
- STANDARD: FREE!
```

## Revolutionary Pricing Model

### The "Last Month Free" Approach

```
$1.99 for 500GB:
