# Encryption Options - Simple Comparison

## Current Plan: Server-Side Encryption (S3 SSE-S3)

### How It Works
```
Your Photo → HTTPS (encrypted) → Photolala → S3 (encrypted at rest)
                                      ↓
                              [Photolala CAN decrypt]
```

### What This Means
| Aspect | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| **Your photos are encrypted** | ✅ Yes, at rest in S3 |
| **Safe from hackers** | ✅ Yes, encrypted |
| **Safe from Photolala** | ❌ No, we can decrypt |
| **Can recover password** | ✅ Yes, we can help |
| **Can restore deleted photos** | ✅ Yes, we can help |
| **Web access** | ✅ Yes, works everywhere |

## Alternative: Client-Side Encryption (Zero-Knowledge)

### How It Would Work
```
Your Photo → Encrypt on phone → Upload encrypted blob → S3
      ↓                                                   ↓
[Only YOU have key]                          [Photolala CANNOT decrypt]
```

### What This Would Mean
| Aspect | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| **Your photos are encrypted** | ✅ Yes, before upload |
| **Safe from hackers** | ✅ Yes, encrypted |
| **Safe from Photolala** | ✅ Yes, we can't decrypt |
| **Can recover password** | ❌ No, lose key = lose photos |
| **Can restore deleted photos** | ❌ No, if you delete key |
| **Web access** | ❌ No, key needed on device |

## The Tradeoff

### Server-Side (What We're Building)
```
Trust Photolala ←→ Get These Benefits:
    ✓ Password recovery
    ✓ Customer support can help
    ✓ Web access from anywhere
    ✓ Share photos easily
    ✓ Smart features (future)
```

### Client-Side (Possible Future Option)
```
Don't Trust Anyone ←→ Accept These Limits:
    ✗ Lose password = lose everything
    ✗ No one can help you
    ✗ Device-only access
    ✗ Complex sharing
    ✗ No smart features
```

## Our Approach

### Phase 1: Build Trust
1. **Strong access controls** - Not everyone can access
2. **Audit everything** - Every access is logged
3. **Clear policies** - When and why we access
4. **Legal protection** - We fight bad requests

### Phase 2: Offer Choice (Maybe)
```
Settings → Privacy → Encryption Mode:

○ Standard (Recommended)
   Full features, we can help you

● Private Mode (Advanced)
   ⚠️ Warning: If you forget your password,
   your photos are gone forever.
   No one can help. Not even us.
   
   [ Enable Private Mode ]
```

## Real-World Examples

### Companies with Server-Side Encryption
- **Google Photos** - Can see your photos
- **iCloud Photos** - Apple can access
- **Dropbox** - Can access your files
- **Amazon Photos** - Amazon can access

### Companies with Client-Side Encryption
- **SpiderOak** - True zero-knowledge
- **Tresorit** - Client-side encrypted
- **pCloud Crypto** - Optional encryption

Most choose server-side because users prefer features over absolute privacy.

## The Bottom Line

### What We're Building (Phase 1)
- Your photos are encrypted in S3
- Photolala admins CAN access with controls
- Every access is logged and audited
- We promise to use access responsibly
- You get full features and support

### Why This Makes Sense
1. **99% of users** want password recovery
2. **Support needs** to help when things break
3. **Features** require server processing
4. **Trust + Controls** is good enough for most

### If You Need Zero-Knowledge
- We understand some users need this
- Consider Phase 2 "Private Mode"
- Or use dedicated zero-knowledge service
- Understand you're on your own
