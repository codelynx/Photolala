# S3 Backup Service - Session Summary

## What We Accomplished

### 1. **Simplified Design Approach**
- Started with complex multi-provider design
- Simplified to Photolala-managed service only
- Fixed region (us-east-1) for simplicity
- No user AWS credentials needed

### 2. **Revolutionary Pricing Model**
**Original**: $2.99 for 100GB
**Final**: $1.99 for 1TB! (10X more for less)

Key innovation: 14-day "hot window" for recent photos
- Last 14 days: Instant access
- Older photos: 12-24 hour retrieval
- Enables 70% cost savings

### 3. **Technical Architecture Decisions**

#### Storage Structure
```
s3://photolala/users/{user-id}/photos/{md5}.dat
s3://photolala/users/{user-id}/thumbs/{md5}.dat
s3://photolala/users/{user-id}/metadata/{md5}.plist
```
- MD5-based deduplication
- Flat structure for simplicity
- Catalog files for efficient browsing

#### Access Control
- Presigned URLs for security
- No direct S3 access from app
- API validates every request
- STS option for future power features

#### Authentication
- Sign in with Apple → Photolala UUID
- No passwords needed
- Secure token management
- Simple account recovery

### 4. **User Experience Design**

#### Deep Archive UX
- Visual badges: ❄️ (archived) → ⏳ (thawing) → ✨ (ready)
- Credit system: 1 credit = 100MB
- Clear retrieval expectations
- Smart batching suggestions

#### Family Features
- Shared credit pool
- Prevent duplicate retrievals
- Activity feed
- Owner-only starring (simplified)

#### Cancellation Policy
- 30-day grace period
- Browse-only mode
- Recovery Pass option ($9.99)
- Thumbnails kept forever

| Essential | $1.99 | 1TB | 14 days |
| Plus | $2.99 | 1.5TB | 21 days |
| Family | $5.99 | 5TB | 30 days |

#### Market Position
