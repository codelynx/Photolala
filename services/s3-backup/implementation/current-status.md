# S3 Backup Service - Current Implementation Status

## Overview
The S3 backup service has been successfully implemented with Sign in with Apple authentication and the new aggressive pricing model ($0.99-$5.99 for 500GB-5TB).

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Core Infrastructure
- **AWS SDK Integration**: Using aws-sdk-swift for S3 operations
- **Authentication**: Sign in with Apple implemented via IdentityManager
- **Keychain Storage**: Secure storage for user credentials and AWS keys
- **Service Architecture**: S3BackupService + S3BackupManager pattern

### 2. Storage & Pricing Model (NEW)
- **Free**: 200MB trial
- **Starter**: $0.99/month - 500GB photos
- **Essential**: $1.99/month - 1TB photos  
- **Plus**: $2.99/month - 2TB photos
- **Family**: $5.99/month - 5TB photos (shareable)

### 3. Smart Storage Implementation
- **Quota System**: Only photos count against storage quota
- **Bonus Storage**: Thumbnails and metadata stored free (not counted)
- **Storage Classes**:
  - Photos: Uploaded directly to Deep Archive (99% cost reduction)
  - Thumbnails: Standard storage (frequently accessed)
  - Metadata: Planned for Standard-IA

### 4. User Interface
- **SignInPromptView**: Clean onboarding with Sign in with Apple
- **SubscriptionView**: StoreKit 2 integration for IAP
- **S3BackupTestView**: Testing interface for backup functionality
- **UserAccountView**: Account management with storage usage display
- **PhotoBrowserView**: Integrated backup button for selected photos

### 5. Code Quality
- **SwiftFormat**: Applied consistent formatting across all files
- **Platform Compatibility**: iOS and macOS support with proper conditionals
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and user feedback

## ❌ Remaining Tasks

### 1. Backend Infrastructure
- Production S3 bucket configuration
- STS temporary credentials system
- Usage tracking service
- Receipt validation endpoint

### 2. S3 Lifecycle Rules (AWS Console)
- Photos: Already in Deep Archive (no transition needed)
- Thumbnails: 7 days Standard → Standard-IA
- Metadata: Direct upload to Standard-IA

### 3. Archive Retrieval UX
- Show "archived" badge on photos in Deep Archive
- Implement restore request functionality
- Add 24-48 hour retrieval time warnings
- Track and display restore status

### 4. Metadata System
- Design metadata schema (EXIF, tags, etc.)
- Implement metadata upload to S3
- Store in Standard-IA for cost optimization

### 5. Production Deployment
- Replace test AWS credentials with production service
- Configure proper IAM roles and policies
- Set up CloudWatch monitoring
- Implement usage analytics

## Technical Debt
- Currently using static AWS credentials (needs STS)
- No metadata backup yet
- Archive retrieval UX not implemented
- Missing production monitoring

## Next Steps
1. Configure S3 lifecycle rules in AWS Console
2. Implement metadata backup system
3. Build archive retrieval UX
4. Set up production AWS infrastructure
5. Deploy backend services for STS and usage tracking

## Code Statistics
- **Files Modified**: 20+ Swift files
- **Lines of Code**: ~2,500 new lines
- **Test Coverage**: Basic manual testing via S3BackupTestView
- **Platform Support**: iOS 18.5+, macOS 14.0+
