# Sign in with Apple Implementation Summary

## Overview

We've successfully implemented Sign in with Apple as the foundation for our identity management system, aligning with our payment strategy of starting with Apple IAP and expanding later.

## Implementation Components

### 1. IdentityManager.swift

Complete identity management system with:
- Sign in with Apple flow (ASAuthorizationController)
- PhotolalaUser model with service ID mapping
- Keychain persistence for secure storage
- Cross-platform support (iOS/macOS)

```swift
struct PhotolalaUser: Codable {
    let serviceUserID: String     // Our internal UUID
    let appleUserID: String       // From Sign in with Apple
    let email: String?            // Optional - user may not share
    let fullName: String?         // Optional - user may not share
    let createdAt: Date
    var subscription: Subscription?
}
```

### 2. Updated S3BackupManager

Now enforces authentication and quotas:
- Requires signed-in user for any backup operations
- Checks storage limits based on subscription tier
- Tracks usage against quota
- Throws appropriate errors for UI handling

Key changes:
```swift
var userId: String? {
    IdentityManager.shared.currentUser?.serviceUserID
}

func uploadPhoto(_ photoRef: PhotoReference) async throws {
    // Check authentication
    guard let userId = userId else {
        throw S3BackupError.notSignedIn
    }
    
    // Check subscription limits
    guard try await canUploadFile(size: Int64(fileSize)) else {
        throw S3BackupError.quotaExceeded
    }
}
```

### 3. UI Components

#### SignInPromptView.swift
- Beautiful onboarding when users try to backup without account
- Shows benefits: 5GB free, secure, cross-device access
- Native Sign in with Apple button
- "Browse Locally Only" escape option

#### SubscriptionUpgradeView.swift
- Shown when storage quota exceeded
- Visual storage usage indicator
- Subscription tier options with pricing
- Recommended tier highlighting

#### UserAccountView.swift
- Menu bar account status
- Shows user name, storage usage, subscription tier
- Sign out option with confirmation

### 4. Integration Points

#### PhotoBrowserView.swift
Updated to handle authentication flow:
```swift
private func backupSelectedPhotos() {
    // Check if signed in
    guard identityManager.isSignedIn else {
        showingSignInPrompt = true
        return
    }
    
    // Proceed with backup...
}
```

#### Photolala.entitlements
Added Sign in with Apple capability:
```xml
<key>com.apple.developer.applesignin</key>
<array>
    <string>Default</string>
</array>
```

## User Flow

1. **Anonymous User**
   - Can browse local photos
   - Sees "Backup" button in toolbar when photos selected
   
2. **Backup Attempt**
   - Clicking "Backup" shows SignInPromptView
   - Clear benefits and Sign in with Apple button
   - Can dismiss to continue browsing locally

3. **After Sign In**
   - Automatically gets 5GB free tier
   - Can backup photos immediately
   - Account info shown in toolbar

4. **Quota Exceeded**
   - SubscriptionUpgradeView appears
   - Shows current usage and limit
   - Subscription options with pricing

## Subscription Tiers

Defined in IdentityManager.swift:
- **Free**: 5 GB
- **Basic**: 100 GB - $2.99/month
- **Standard**: 1 TB - $9.99/month  
- **Pro**: 5 TB - $39.99/month
- **Family**: 10 TB - $69.99/month

## Security Implementation

- Apple ID tokens validated with nonce
- Service user ID stored in Keychain
- No passwords or sensitive data in UserDefaults
- Subscription info tied to service user ID

## Current Limitations

1. **No IAP Integration Yet**
   - Subscription tiers defined but not purchasable
   - All users get free tier for now

2. **Test AWS Credentials**
   - Still using developer AWS credentials
   - Need to implement Photolala-managed service

3. **No Backend Services**
   - User creation is local only
   - No subscription validation
   - No usage tracking persistence

## Next Steps

1. **StoreKit 2 Integration**
   - Implement IAP for subscription tiers
   - Receipt validation
   - Subscription management UI

2. **Backend Services**
   - User registration endpoint
   - Subscription validation
   - Usage tracking API

3. **Production AWS Integration**
   - Remove user AWS credential option
   - Implement Photolala-managed S3 service
   - Secure credential management

## Code Quality

- Proper error handling throughout
- Async/await for all async operations
- SwiftUI and UIKit/AppKit integration
- Cross-platform considerations
- Clear separation of concerns

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Sign in with Apple flow works
- [ ] User persists across app launches
- [ ] Sign out clears all user data
- [ ] Backup requires authentication
- [ ] Quota enforcement works
- [ ] UI shows correct account status
- [ ] Error handling for all edge cases

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully establishes the foundation for our identity-first backup service. Users must authenticate before accessing cloud features, setting up the monetization path through IAP subscriptions while maintaining a good user experience with local browsing for non-authenticated users.
