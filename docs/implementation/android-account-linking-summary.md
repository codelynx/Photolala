# Android Account Linking Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the Android implementation of account linking completed on July 30, 2025, achieving full platform parity with iOS/macOS.

## Files Modified

### Core Services
1. **IdentityManager.kt**
   - Added `linkProvider()` - initiates provider linking
   - Added `completeLinkProvider()` - completes linking after authentication
   - Added `unlinkProvider()` - removes provider with S3 cleanup
   - Added `handleGoogleLinkResult()` - handles Google Sign-In for linking
   - Added `handleAppleLinkCallback()` - handles Apple Sign-In for linking
   - New exception types: `ProviderAlreadyLinked`, `ProviderInUse`, `ProviderNotLinked`, `CannotUnlinkLastProvider`

2. **S3Service.kt**
   - Added `deleteObject()` method for S3 identity mapping deletion

### UI Components (New Files)
3. **AccountSettingsScreen.kt** (NEW)
   - Material3 design with card-based layout
   - User header with avatar and profile info
   - Storage usage display with progress bar
   - Subscription information card
   - Sign-in methods management
   - Link/unlink functionality with confirmation dialogs

4. **AccountSettingsViewModel.kt** (NEW)
   - Manages account settings UI state
   - Coordinates authentication flows
   - Handles Google and Apple Sign-In for linking

### Navigation & Integration
5. **PhotolalaNavigation.kt**
   - Added `AccountSettings` route
   - Integration with Google Sign-In launcher
   - Apple Sign-In flow state management
   - Proper ViewModel handling

6. **WelcomeScreen.kt**
   - Added "Account Settings" button to SignedInCard
   - Updated navigation callback for settings

7. **MainActivity.kt**
   - Enhanced Apple Sign-In callback handling
   - Detects account linking flow vs regular sign-in
   - Routes to appropriate handler based on flow state

## Key Features Implemented

### Account Linking
- Link multiple providers (Apple ID, Google) to one account
- Validation prevents duplicate linking
- Check if provider is already used by another account
- S3 identity mapping creation for new links

### Account Unlinking
- Remove linked providers with confirmation dialog
- Complete S3 identity mapping deletion
- Cannot unlink the last remaining provider
- Immediate effect on sign-in capabilities

### UI/UX
- Modern Material3 design matching iOS/macOS functionality
- Card-based layout with proper spacing and shadows
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Loading states and error handling
- Responsive to authentication state changes

### Error Handling
- Clear error messages for all scenarios
- User-friendly explanations
- Proper exception types for different failures
- Graceful handling of edge cases

## Technical Details

### Authentication Flow
1. User navigates to Account Settings
2. Taps "Link Another Sign-In Method"
3. Selects provider (filtered to show only unlinked)
4. Authentication initiated:
   - Google: Intent-based with result handling
   - Apple: Web-based with deep link callback
5. On success, provider is linked and S3 mapping created
6. UI updates to show new linked provider

### Data Model
The existing `PhotolalaUser` model already supported `linkedProviders`, making integration straightforward:
```kotlin
data class PhotolalaUser(
    val serviceUserID: String,
    val primaryProvider: AuthProvider,
    val linkedProviders: List<ProviderLink> = emptyList(),
    // ... other fields
)
```

### Platform Parity
Android now matches iOS/macOS with:
- ✅ Multi-provider authentication
- ✅ Account linking/unlinking functionality
- ✅ S3 identity mapping management
- ✅ Modern UI design (Material3 vs SwiftUI)
- ✅ Confirmation dialogs
- ✅ Complete error handling
- ✅ Deep link support for authentication

## Testing Performed

### Build Verification
- ✅ Clean build successful
- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ Only acceptable deprecation warnings

### Code Quality
- Proper error handling throughout
- Consistent code style
- Clear separation of concerns
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

## Documentation Updates

1. **PROJECT_STATUS.md**
   - Updated Recent Updates section to include Android
   - Added Android implementation details

2. **account-linking.md**
   - Added Android platform support
   - Listed Android-specific components

3. **CLAUDE.md**
   - Updated key features to include account linking
