## Key Implementation Details

### iOS/macOS
- GoogleSignIn SDK v8.0.0 with async/await API
- Both GoogleSignIn and GoogleSignInSwift frameworks linked
- OAuth clients configured for iOS and macOS bundle IDs

### Android
- Legacy Google Sign-In API (Credential Manager had Error 28444)
- Activity-based authentication flow
- Same Web Client ID shared with iOS for consistency

### Cross-Platform
- S3-based identity persistence (`/identities/{provider}:{providerID}`)
- Enables sign-in from any device
- Consistent user experience across platforms

## Next Steps

1. Monitor authentication usage and error rates
2. Consider implementing email/password authentication
3. Plan for proper backend service to replace S3 identity mapping
4. Add Apple Sign-In for Android when better supported
