# Credential System Implementation Summary

## Date: September 20, 2024

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive credential management system for Photolala2 using credential-code for encryption and in-app configuration for environment selection.

## Major Changes

### 1. Credential Organization
✅ **Created `.credentials/` directory structure**
- Organized by service: aws/, apple/, google/, jwt/
- Each environment (dev/stage/prod) has separate credential files
- All credentials gitignored for security

### 2. Credential Encryption
✅ **Integrated credential-code tool**
- Copied from Photolala1 to `.credential-tool/`
- Generates encrypted `Credentials.swift` and `Credentials.kt`
- All environments encrypted together in single binary
- Uses AES-256-GCM encryption

### 3. Generated Files
✅ **Created encrypted credential files**
- `apple/Photolala/Credentials/Credentials.swift` - iOS/macOS
- `android/.../credentials/Credentials.kt` - Android
- Contains all environments (dev/stage/prod) in one file

### 4. Environment Management
✅ **Switched to in-app configuration**
- Uses UserDefaults (iOS) / SharedPreferences (Android)
- No external config files needed
- Production builds locked to production environment
- Removed obsolete `.credentials/config.json`
- Removed obsolete `scripts/switch-env.sh`

### 5. Scripts Created
✅ **Management scripts**
- `scripts/generate-credentials.sh` - Regenerate encrypted files
- `scripts/validate-credentials.sh` - Validate credential setup
- ~~`scripts/switch-env.sh`~~ - REMOVED (replaced by in-app selection)

### 6. Documentation
✅ **Comprehensive security documentation**
- `docs/security.md` - Overall security architecture
- `docs/credential-security.md` - Deep dive into credential encryption
- `CREDENTIAL_PLAN.md` - Original implementation plan
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` - Added credential management section
- Updated `.credentials/README.md` - Removed config.json references

### 7. Security Improvements
✅ **Enhanced security posture**
- All credentials encrypted at rest
- Single binary contains all environments
- Runtime environment selection
- No plain text credentials in source
- Clear incident response procedures
- Documented threat model

## Key Design Decisions

### Why In-App Configuration?
- **Self-contained**: No external files to manage
- **Persistent**: UserDefaults survives app updates
- **Native**: Uses platform-standard storage
- **Secure**: Can't accidentally commit config files

### Why All Environments in One Binary?
- **Simplicity**: One build for all environments
- **Testing**: Easy to switch environments for QA
- **Security**: All equally encrypted
- **Distribution**: Single app store submission

### Why credential-code?
- **Proven**: Used successfully in Photolala1
- **Secure**: Strong encryption (AES-256)
- **Simple**: Just run a script to update
- **Offline**: No runtime credential fetching needed

## Files Removed
- `scripts/switch-env.sh` - No longer needed
- `.credentials/config.json` - Replaced by UserDefaults

## Files Modified
- `.gitignore` - Added `.credentials/` and `.credential-tool/`
- `.credentials/README.md` - Removed config.json references
- `scripts/validate-credentials.sh` - Removed config.json check
- `CLAUDE.md` - Added credential management section

## Credentials Migrated from Photolala1
- ✅ AWS Access Keys (dev/stage/prod)
- ✅ AWS Secret Keys (dev/stage/prod)
- ✅ Apple Sign-In private key
- ✅ Apple Key ID: FPZRF65BMT
- ✅ Apple Team ID: 2P97EM4L4N

## Next Steps
1. Add Google OAuth credentials when ready
2. Add JWT secret for Lambda functions
3. Test credential rotation procedure
4. Consider adding credential expiry monitoring
5. Implement in-app developer settings UI for environment switching

## Security Notes
- Never commit `.credentials/` directory
- Credentials are safe in generated files (encrypted)
- If source code is exposed, credentials remain secure
- Rotation requires app update (acceptable trade-off)
- Production builds automatically use production credentials

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Build app with generated credentials
- [ ] Verify dev environment works
- [ ] Verify stage environment works
- [ ] Verify prod environment works (carefully)
- [ ] Test UserDefaults persistence
- [ ] Verify production build locks to prod

## Conclusion
The credential system is now much cleaner and more secure than Photolala1. All credentials are centralized, encrypted, and managed through simple scripts. The in-app configuration approach eliminates external dependencies while maintaining flexibility for development.
