# Android AWS Integration Setup
Date: 2025-07-02

## Overview
Successfully set up AWS credential management and S3 integration for the Android app using the credential-code tool.

## Changes Made

### 1. Generated Encrypted AWS Credentials
- Used credential-code tool to generate encrypted Kotlin credentials
- Source: `/Users/kyoshikawa/Projects/Photolala/.credential-code/credentials.json`
- Generated: `Credentials.kt` with encrypted AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, and AWS_DEFAULT_REGION
- Placed in: `com.electricwoods.photolala.utils` package

### 2. Created AWS Credential Provider
- `AWSCredentialProvider.kt`: Implements AWS SDK's credential provider interface
- Decrypts credentials on-demand from encrypted storage
- Caches decrypted credentials for performance
- Provides region configuration

### 3. Set Up Dependency Injection
- `AWSModule.kt`: Hilt module for AWS services
- Provides singleton instances of:
  - AWSCredentialsProvider
  - AmazonS3Client (configured with proper region)

### 4. Created S3 Service
- `S3Service.kt`: High-level service for S3 operations
- Features:
  - Upload photos from URI
  - List photos with optional prefix
  - Delete photos
  - Generate pre-signed URLs for secure downloads
- Uses coroutines for async operations
- Handles temporary file creation for uploads

## Security Features
- Credentials are encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM
- Decryption key is obfuscated in the compiled code
- No plaintext credentials in source code
- Credentials are only decrypted when needed

## Usage Example
```kotlin
// Inject the S3 service
@Inject lateinit var s3Service: S3Service

// Upload a photo
viewModelScope.launch {
    val photoUri = // ... get photo URI
    val key = "user123/photo_${System.currentTimeMillis()}.jpg"
    val s3Url = s3Service.uploadPhoto(photoUri, key)
    // Photo uploaded to: https://photolala.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/user123/photo_xxx.jpg
}
```

## Run Configuration Fix
Created Android Studio run configuration file at:
`.idea/runConfigurations/app.xml`

To fix "Module not specified" error:
1. Sync project with Gradle files
2. Invalidate caches and restart
3. Select "app" module in run configuration

## Next Steps
1. Implement backup queue manager for Android
2. Add S3 cloud browser screen
3. Implement photo backup functionality
4. Add progress tracking for uploads
5. Handle offline/retry scenarios

## Testing
The app builds successfully with AWS integration. To test:
1. Start Android emulator or connect device
2. Run: `./gradlew installDebug`
3. Launch: `adb shell am start -n com.electricwoods.photolala/.MainActivity`

The AWS credentials are now securely embedded in the Android app and ready for S3 operations.
