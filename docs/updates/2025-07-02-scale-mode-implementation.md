# Scale Mode (Fit/Fill) Implementation Update
Date: 2025-07-02

## Overview
Successfully implemented scale mode options (Scale to Fit / Scale to Fill) for photo thumbnails on both iOS and Android platforms, respecting device-aware thumbnail sizing.

## Changes Made

### iOS Implementation

1. **PhotoBrowserToolbar.swift**:
   - Added scale mode toggle to iOS toolbar within the unified gear menu
   - Scale mode option appears in "Display Options" section
   - Toggle button shows current mode and switches between "Scale to Fit" and "Scale to Fill"
   - Uses system icons: `aspectratio` for fit, `aspectratio.fill` for fill

2. **UnifiedPhotoCell.swift**:
   - Updated `configure()` method to respect scale mode from settings
   - Added `updateDisplayMode()` method for dynamic updates
   - Scale mode affects both `ScalableImageView` on macOS and `UIImageView.contentMode` on iOS

3. **UnifiedPhotoCollectionViewController.swift**:
   - Collection view cells automatically update when settings change
   - `updateVisibleCells()` refreshes all cells with new scale mode

### Android Implementation

1. **GridViewOptionsMenu.kt**:
   - Added new "Scale Mode" section to the options menu
   - Radio button selection for "Scale to Fit" and "Scale to Fill"
   - Follows Material Design patterns with proper sectioning

2. **PhotoGridScreen.kt**:
   - Added `gridScaleMode` state variable (default: "fill")
   - Passes scale mode to `PhotoThumbnail` composable
   - Uses `ContentScale.Fit` or `ContentScale.Crop` based on selection

3. **PreferencesManager.kt**:
   - Added `KEY_GRID_SCALE_MODE` preference
   - Persists user's scale mode choice across app sessions

## Platform Differences

### iOS/macOS:
- Scale mode toggle integrated into existing toolbar
- iOS uses unified gear menu to save space
- macOS keeps separate toolbar buttons
- Uses native `contentMode` properties

### Android:
- Scale mode in dropdown menu with other view options
- Uses Compose's `ContentScale` enum
- Material Design radio button selection

## User Experience
- Both platforms default to "Scale to Fill" for consistent grid appearance
- "Scale to Fit" shows entire photo with letterboxing if needed
- "Scale to Fill" crops to fill thumbnail area (standard behavior)
- Settings persist across app sessions
- Immediate visual feedback when toggling

## Technical Notes
- Scale mode works within device-aware thumbnail size constraints (max 256px)
- No performance impact - only changes rendering mode
- Respects all existing features (selection, tags, etc.)

## Testing Completed
- ✅ iOS Simulator build successful
- ✅ Android build successful with minor deprecation warnings
- ✅ Scale mode toggles correctly on both platforms
- ✅ Visual appearance matches expected behavior
- ✅ Settings persist across app restarts

## Future Considerations
- Could add per-folder scale mode preferences
- Might add animation when switching modes
- Consider adding aspect ratio indicators for extreme ratios
