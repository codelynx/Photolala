# S3 Backup Implementation Session - June 18, 2025

## Overview
Successfully implemented S3 photo backup and browsing functionality with catalog-first architecture.

## Major Changes Implemented

### 1. Test Mode Removal
- **Decision**: Removed all test user mode functionality
- **Impact**: Both DEBUG and RELEASE builds now require Sign in with Apple authentication
- **Files Modified**:
  - `S3BackupTestView.swift` - Removed authMode picker and test user UI
  - `S3PhotoBrowserView.swift` - Removed hardcoded test user IDs

### 2. File Extension Standardization
- **Decision**: Use `.dat` extension for all files (photos, thumbnails)
- **Rationale**: Photos may not always be JPEG (could be PNG, HEIC, etc.)
- **Implementation**:
  - Photos: `photos/{userId}/{md5}.dat`
  - Thumbnails: `thumbnails/{userId}/{md5}.dat`
  - Metadata: `metadata/{userId}/{md5}.plist`

### 3. AWS Credentials Management
- **Added**: `AWSCredentialsView.swift` for credential configuration
- **Storage**: Credentials stored securely in Keychain
- **Priority**: Environment variables → Keychain → ~/.aws/credentials file
- **UI Flow**: Sign in → Configure AWS (if needed) → Upload photos

### 4. S3 Client Initialization Fix
- **Problem**: S3 clients were being created without credentials
- **Solution**: All S3 clients now obtained from `S3BackupManager.shared.getS3Client()`
- **Files Fixed**:
  - `S3PhotoBrowserView.swift`
  - `S3DownloadService.swift`

### 5. Development Tools
- **Added**: "Clean Up All" button in DEBUG builds
- **Functionality**: Deletes all user data from S3 (handles versioning)
- **Location**: `S3BackupTestView.swift`
- **Features**:
  - Deletes photos, thumbnails, metadata, and catalogs
  - Handles versioned objects properly
  - Clears local cache

### 6. Bucket Versioning
- **Initial State**: Versioning was enabled (unexpected)
- **Current State**: Versioning suspended
- **Decision**: Keep current bucket, plan proper dev/staging/prod strategy later
- **Script Created**: `recreate-bucket-no-versioning.sh` (for future use)

## Implementation Details

### Catalog System
- Successfully implemented 16-shard catalog system
- Format: `.photolala`, `.photolala#0` through `.photolala#f`
- Automatic catalog generation after photo uploads
- Efficient sync using manifest timestamps

### Photo Upload Flow
1. User selects photos
2. System calculates MD5 hash
3. Uploads photo as `.dat` file
4. Generates and uploads thumbnail
5. Uploads metadata (EXIF, dimensions, etc.)
6. Automatically regenerates catalog

### Photo Browsing Flow
1. Syncs catalog from S3 (if needed)
2. Loads photos from local catalog cache
3. Downloads thumbnails on demand
4. Caches thumbnails locally

## Deviations from Original Design

1. **File Extensions**: Changed from mixed extensions to unified `.dat`
2. **Test Mode**: Completely removed instead of keeping for development
3. **Versioning**: Bucket had versioning enabled (now suspended)
4. **Automatic Catalog**: Added automatic catalog generation after uploads

## Known Issues Resolved

1. ✅ Fixed S3 client credential initialization
2. ✅ Fixed file extension mismatches
3. ✅ Fixed catalog sync offline mode issues
4. ✅ Added proper cleanup for versioned objects
5. ✅ Suspended bucket versioning

## Next Steps

1. Plan development/staging/production bucket strategy
2. Implement photo restoration from Deep Archive
3. Add progress indicators for uploads/downloads
4. Implement batch operations
5. Add error handling and retry logic

## Technical Debt

1. Need proper dev/staging/prod separation
2. Should implement proper error handling throughout
3. Need to add upload progress tracking
4. Missing unit tests for S3 operations
