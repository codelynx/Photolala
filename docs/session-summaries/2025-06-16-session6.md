# Session 6: Batch Photo Selection for Archive Retrieval

**Date**: June 16, 2025  
**Focus**: Implementing batch photo selection support for archive retrieval

## Summary

Added support for restoring multiple archived photos at once through the PhotoRetrievalView dialog. Users can now select multiple photos in the grid and restore them all with a single operation, with accurate cost calculations based on the actual sizes of archived photos.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced ArchivedPhotoInfo Model
- Added `originalSize: Int64` property to track file sizes for cost calculations
- Updated PhotoManager to populate this field when loading archive status from S3

### 2. Updated PhotoRetrievalView
- Modified to accept an array of `selectedPhotos` from PhotoBrowserView
- Intelligent UI that defaults to "Selected photos" option when multiple archived photos are selected
- Filters out non-archived photos automatically
- Calculates total size and cost based on actual file sizes

### 3. Batch Restore Logic
- Implemented batch restore operations in `startRetrieval()`
- Processes all selected archived photos in parallel
- Handles MD5 hash computation for photos that don't have it cached
- Proper error aggregation for batch operations

### 4. Cost Calculation Improvements
- Removed hardcoded size estimates
- Uses actual file sizes from ArchivedPhotoInfo
- Accurate cost calculations for both single and batch operations
- Shows total size in human-readable format

## Technical Details

### Key Code Changes

1. **ArchivedPhotoInfo struct**:
```swift
struct ArchivedPhotoInfo {
    // ... existing properties ...
    let originalSize: Int64 // Added for cost calculations
}
```

2. **PhotoRetrievalView initialization**:
```swift
init(photoReference: PhotoReference, archiveInfo: ArchivedPhotoInfo, 
     selectedPhotos: [PhotoReference] = [], isPresented: Binding<Bool>) {
    // Defaults to selected photos option if multiple archived photos selected
    let archivedSelectedPhotos = selectedPhotos.filter { 
        $0.archiveInfo != nil && !$0.archiveInfo!.storageClass.isImmediatelyAccessible 
    }
    if archivedSelectedPhotos.count > 1 {
        self._selectedOption = State(initialValue: .selectedPhotos)
    }
}
```

3. **Batch size calculation**:
```swift
let totalBytes = selectedPhotos.reduce(Int64(0)) { sum, photo in
    guard let archiveInfo = photo.archiveInfo,
          !archiveInfo.storageClass.isImmediatelyAccessible else {
        return sum
    }
    return sum + archiveInfo.originalSize
}
```

## Testing Notes

- Verified that ArchivedPhotoInfo is properly populated with size data
- Tested batch selection with mixed archived and non-archived photos
- Confirmed cost calculations are accurate
- UI properly defaults to batch option when appropriate

## Next Steps

1. Add progress tracking for batch restore operations
2. Implement notifications when batch restores complete
3. Add visual feedback showing which photos are being restored
4. Consider adding a progress bar for large batch operations
