# Session Summary: Credential Code Integration
Date: 2025-06-23

## Overview
Integrated credential-code library to securely manage AWS credentials, removing hardcoded secrets from the Xcode scheme and git history.

## Problem
- AWS credentials were hardcoded in the Xcode scheme file
- GitHub push protection blocked pushes due to exposed secrets in git history
- Security risk of exposed credentials in source control

## Solution
Implemented credential-code library to encrypt AWS credentials at build time and decrypt them only in memory at runtime.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Hardcoded Credentials
- **File**: `Photolala.xcodeproj/xcshareddata/xcschemes/photolala.xcscheme`
- Removed environment variables containing AWS credentials

### 2. Set Up Credential-Code
- Cloned credential-code repository to `.credential-code-tool/`
- Built the tool locally
- Initialized credential storage with `credential-code init`
- Added `.credential-code/` to `.gitignore`

### 3. Created Encrypted Credentials
- **File**: `Photolala/Utilities/Credentials.swift`
- Generated encrypted Swift code containing AWS credentials
- Credentials are encrypted using AES-256-GCM
- Decryption happens only in memory at runtime

### 4. Updated S3BackupService
- **File**: `Photolala/Services/S3BackupService.swift`
- Added encrypted credentials as third option in credential loading hierarchy:
  1. Keychain (user's custom credentials)
  2. Environment variables (development)
  3. Encrypted credentials (built-in fallback)
- Removed ~/.aws/credentials file support (no longer needed)

### 5. Enhanced KeychainManager
- **File**: `Photolala/Services/KeychainManager.swift`
- Added `loadAWSCredentialsWithFallback()` method
- Added `hasAnyAWSCredentials()` method to check all credential sources

### 6. Updated S3BackupManager
- **File**: `Photolala/Services/S3BackupManager.swift`
- Changed credential check from `hasAWSCredentials()` to `hasAnyAWSCredentials()`

### 7. Updated Documentation
- **File**: `CLAUDE.md`
- Added AWS Credential Management section
- Documented credential loading priority
- Added instructions for updating credentials

## Security Improvements
1. No more hardcoded secrets in source control
2. Credentials are encrypted at build time
3. Unique encryption key for each build
4. Credentials only decrypted in memory
5. No string literals containing secrets

## Testing
- Successfully built the app with encrypted credentials
- Verified credential loading works without environment variables
- App can now access S3 without exposed secrets

## Future Considerations
- The AWSCredentialsView remains available for users who want to use their own AWS credentials
- Could add credential rotation reminders
- Consider adding support for multiple AWS accounts/regions

## Files Changed
- `.gitignore` - Added .credential-code/
- `CLAUDE.md` - Added credential management documentation
- `Photolala/Services/KeychainManager.swift` - Added fallback methods
- `Photolala/Services/S3BackupManager.swift` - Updated credential check
- `Photolala/Services/S3BackupService.swift` - Added encrypted credential fallback, removed ~/.aws/credentials support
- `Photolala/Utilities/Credentials.swift` - New encrypted credentials file (auto-generated)
- `docs/current/architecture.md` - Added Security section with credential management details
- `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md` - Added entry #47 for credential-code integration
- `.credential-code-tool/` - Local build of credential-code tool (not tracked in git)
