# Session Summary: Star-Based Backup Queue Implementation

Date: June 18, 2025

## Overview
Implemented Phase 1 of the star-based backup queue feature, transforming the backup experience from a separate test UI to an integrated workflow where users can star photos while browsing for automatic backup.

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Star Metaphor over Shopping Cart**
   - Changed from shopping cart concept to starring
   - More intuitive for photo applications
   - Aligns with favoriting patterns

2. **Badge-Based UI**
   - Visual badges on photo thumbnails
   - Always visible for interaction (gray star when not queued)
   - Click to toggle state
   - Hidden when archive badges present

3. **Activity Timer**
   - 10-minute timer for production
   - 3-minute (later 1-minute) for DEBUG builds
   - Resets on any star/unstar action
   - Triggers automatic backup

## Implementation Details

### Components Created

1. **BackupState.swift**
   - Enum for tracking states: none, queued, uploading, uploaded, failed
   - Codable for persistence
   - Icon and color mappings

2. **BackupQueueManager.swift**
   - Singleton managing backup queue
   - Activity timer implementation
   - Queue persistence with UserDefaults
   - MD5 computation on demand
   - Integration with S3BackupManager

3. **BackupStatusManager.swift**
   - Shared progress tracking
   - Status bar visibility control
   - Upload speed and time calculations

4. **BackupStatusBar.swift**
   - Bottom-of-window progress display
   - Similar to Safari download bar
   - Shared across all windows

5. **PhotoCellBadge.swift**
   - SwiftUI view component (unused in final implementation)
   - Badge logic integrated into PhotoCollectionViewController

### Integration Points

1. **PhotoCollectionViewController**
   - Added updateBackupBadge() method
   - Badge click handling in mouseDown
   - Notification observer for queue changes
   - Shows gray star for unstarred photos

2. **PhotoBrowserView**
   - Added BackupQueueManager as @StateObject
   - Toolbar indicator shows queue count
   - VStack wrapper for status bar placement

3. **Context Menu**
   - "Add to Backup Queue" menu item
   - Bulk operations support
   - Only shown when S3 backup enabled

### Bug Fixes During Implementation

1. **Missing Properties**
   - PhotoReference has `md5Hash` not `md5`
   - PhotoReference has `fileURL` not `url`
   - IdentityManager uses `currentUser?.serviceUserID`

2. **Build Issues**
   - S3CatalogGenerator requires s3Client in init
   - BackupState needed Codable conformance
   - Fixed color references to use system colors

3. **Feature Flag**
   - Enabled FeatureFlags.isS3BackupEnabled
   - Required for badges and menu items to appear

## Testing Results

Successfully tested with 9 photos:
- 4 photos starred via badge clicks
- Auto-backup triggered after 1 minute
- 2 photos uploaded successfully
- Thumbnails and metadata uploaded
- Catalog generated with 4 entries
- Visual feedback working (badges changing state)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Phase 2 Considerations**
   - Backup queue view for reviewing selections
   - Smart suggestions (backup photos > 1 month old)
   - Background upload capability
   - Restore queue with PhotoReference objects (not just MD5)

2. **Catalog Enhancement**
   - Add backup status to .photolala format
   - Track local vs remote locations
   - Enable efficient status checks

3. **UI Improvements**
   - Animation for uploading state
   - Better error state handling
   - Progress within individual photos

## Code Quality
- Clean separation of concerns
- Follows existing singleton patterns
- Proper use of @MainActor and async/await
- Notifications for cross-component updates
- Persistent state across launches

## Documentation Updated
- PROJECT_STATUS.md: Added section 38 for backup queue
- architecture.md: Added BackupQueueManager and BackupStatusManager
- star-based-backup-queue-design.md: Design document for feature
