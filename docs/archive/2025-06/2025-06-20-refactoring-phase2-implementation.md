# Refactoring Phase 2 Implementation - 2025-06-20

## Summary

Implemented Phase 2 of the photo loading architecture refactoring, adding priority queue system and progressive directory loading for significantly improved user experience with large photo directories.

## Components Implemented

### 1. PriorityThumbnailLoader

**File**: `Photolala/Services/PriorityThumbnailLoader.swift`

A sophisticated thumbnail loading system that prioritizes visible items:

- **Priority Levels**:
  - `visible`: Currently on screen (highest priority)
  - `nearVisible`: Within 1-2 screens of visible area
  - `prefetch`: Further away but worth loading
  - `background`: Everything else (lowest priority)

- **Key Features**:
  - Automatic queue reordering based on scroll position
  - Concurrent loading with configurable limits
  - Cancellation of non-visible requests during fast scrolling
  - Integration with NSCollectionView for automatic visible range detection

### 2. ProgressivePhotoLoader

**File**: `Photolala/Services/ProgressivePhotoLoader.swift`

Loads photos progressively for instant perceived performance:

- **Loading Strategy**:
  1. Check for catalog - instant results if available
  2. Load first 200 photos immediately
  3. Continue loading remaining photos in 100-photo batches
  4. Generate/update catalog in background for next time

- **Key Features**:
  - Catalog verification to detect new/deleted files
  - Progress tracking with status updates
  - Cancellable operations
  - Background catalog generation

### 3. DirectoryPhotoProvider

**File**: `Photolala/Services/DirectoryPhotoProvider.swift`

Integrates both systems into a cohesive photo provider:

- Combines ProgressivePhotoLoader and PriorityThumbnailLoader
- Implements PhotoProvider protocol for compatibility
- Automatic scroll monitoring for priority updates
- Progress and status tracking

### 4. Integration Documentation

Integration guidance has been included as comments in the implementation files, showing how to integrate the enhanced loading into existing views with minimal changes.

## Technical Details

### Priority Queue Algorithm

```swift
// Sort by priority, then by request time
loadingQueue.sort { lhs, rhs in
    if lhs.priority == rhs.priority {
        return lhs.requestTime < rhs.requestTime
    }
    return lhs.priority < rhs.priority
}
```

### Visible Range Calculation

```swift
func visibleIndices(for collectionView: NSCollectionView) -> Range<Int> {
    // Calculate based on visible rect and item layout
    let itemsPerRow = Int((width + spacing) / (itemSize.width + spacing))
    let firstRow = Int((visibleRect.minY) / (itemSize.height + spacing))
    let lastRow = Int((visibleRect.maxY) / (itemSize.height + spacing))
    return (firstRow * itemsPerRow)..<((lastRow + 1) * itemsPerRow)
}
```

### Progressive Loading Flow

1. **Instant**: Load from catalog if available
2. **Fast**: First 200 photos loaded immediately
3. **Background**: Remaining photos in 100-photo batches
4. **Verify**: Check catalog accuracy in background
5. **Update**: Regenerate catalog if needed

## Performance Impact

### Before (Phase 1 only):
- All photos loaded at once
- Thumbnails generated in file order
- UI blocked until all photos discovered

### After (Phase 2):
- First photos appear instantly (from catalog)
- Visible thumbnails load first
- UI remains responsive during loading
- Smooth scrolling even with 10,000+ photos

## Integration Guide

To use the enhanced loading in existing views:

1. Replace `LocalPhotoProvider` with `DirectoryPhotoProvider`
2. Add scroll monitoring for priority updates
3. Update visible range in collection view updates

Minimal code changes required for significant performance gains.

## Next Steps

With Phase 2 complete, potential Phase 3 improvements:

1. **Catalog Enhancements**:
   - Incremental updates instead of full regeneration
   - Version tracking for compatibility
   - Compression for smaller catalog files

2. **Memory Optimization**:
   - Unload off-screen thumbnails under memory pressure
   - Adaptive cache sizing based on system resources

3. **Network Optimization**:
   - Similar priority system for S3 photo loading
   - Progressive loading for cloud directories

## Code Quality

All new code follows established patterns:
- Proper use of async/await
- Clear separation of concerns
- Comprehensive documentation
- Error handling and cancellation support
