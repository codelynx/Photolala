# Inspector Panel Implementation Session

Date: June 19, 2025

## Summary

Implemented an inspector panel as a modern alternative to context menus for displaying photo information and actions in Photolala.

## Context Menu Investigation

Started by investigating why right-click context menus weren't working properly:
- Tried various approaches including gesture recognizers, event forwarding, and responder chain manipulation
- Discovered that NSCollectionView's context menu system was intercepting events
- Concluded that fighting the framework was not productive

## Pivot to Inspector Panel

Decided to implement an inspector panel instead, which provides:
- Better user experience than context menus
- Always visible and accessible
- Touch-friendly for iOS/iPadOS
- Familiar pattern for Mac users (Finder, Photos, Xcode)

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

1. **InspectorView.swift**
   - Main inspector content view
   - Adaptive layout based on selection:
     - Empty state: "Select photos to view details"
     - Single selection: Full photo details
     - Multiple selection: Grid preview and summary
   - Shows photo information, quick actions, and metadata

2. **InspectorContainer.swift**
   - Handles platform-specific presentation
   - macOS: Sidebar with HStack layout
   - iOS/iPad: Modal sheet or popover
   - Includes view extension for easy integration

3. **PhotoBrowserView Integration**
   - Added inspector state and toggle
   - Toolbar button with info icon
   - Keyboard shortcut (âŒ˜I)
   - Menu command in View menu

### Key Features

- **Dynamic Content**: Updates based on selection
- **Platform Adaptive**: Different presentations for each platform
- **Quick Actions**: Show in Finder, Share, Star for backup
- **Rich Information**: File size, dimensions, dates, metadata
- **Smooth Animation**: Slide in/out with easeInOut animation

## Bug Fixes

### Selection Sync Issue
- Problem: Selected photos weren't always reflected in inspector
- Solution: 
  - Added computed property for clean type conversion
  - Used `.id()` modifier to force view updates
  - Added debug logging to track selection changes

### Layout Overlap Issue
- Problem: Inspector covered rightmost thumbnails
- Solution:
  - Changed from `overlay` to `HStack` layout
  - Content area now shrinks when inspector is shown
  - Added divider between content and inspector
  - Thumbnails remain fully visible

## Technical Decisions

1. **SwiftUI Over AppKit**: Used SwiftUI for the inspector content for easier cross-platform support
2. **Singleton Pattern Avoided**: Each window has its own inspector state
3. **Type-Safe Selection**: Used `[any PhotoItem]` for flexibility with both PhotoFile and PhotoS3
4. **Notification Pattern**: Used NotificationCenter for menu command communication

## Results

- Successfully replaced context menus with a more discoverable inspector panel
- Improved user experience with persistent information display
- Maintained platform conventions (sidebar on macOS, sheet on iOS)
- Fixed all selection synchronization issues
- Resolved layout overlap problems

## Future Enhancements

1. Add real EXIF metadata reading
2. Implement star/backup functionality
3. Add in-place editing capabilities
4. Show GPS location on map
5. Add file history and backup status
6. Support for batch operations on multiple selections

## Lessons Learned

1. Sometimes it's better to pivot to a different UI pattern than fight the framework
2. Inspector panels provide better UX than context menus for information-rich interfaces
3. Platform-adaptive design requires careful consideration of each platform's conventions
4. Proper layout (HStack) is better than overlays for sidebars to avoid content overlap
