# Session Summary: Backup Persistence & Metadata Fixes
**Date**: June 20, 2025
**Focus**: Fixed backup queue persistence and S3 metadata decoding issues

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Backup Status Not Persisting
**Problem**: Photos that were starred and uploaded weren't showing their backup status after app restart. The BackupQueueManager had 10 backup entries but was only matching 9 photos out of 12.

**Root Cause**: The path-to-MD5 mapping wasn't being properly maintained. Photos without backup status (non-starred) weren't having their MD5s stored for future reference.

**Solution**: Updated `matchPhotosWithBackupStatus` in BackupQueueManager to:
- Always store MD5 hashes in pathToMD5 mapping (even for non-starred photos)
- Add better logging to distinguish between photos with/without backup status
- Save the updated mappings after matching operations
- Track restoration statistics (restoredFromPath counter)

### 2. Metadata Decoding Errors
**Problem**: S3 catalog generation was failing with "keyNotFound" errors when trying to decode metadata.

**Root Cause**: Structure mismatch - S3BackupService uploads `PhotoMetadata` objects, but S3CatalogGenerator was expecting `PhotoMetadataInfo` with different field names.

**Solution**: Updated S3CatalogGenerator's `downloadMetadata` method to:
- Decode as PhotoMetadata (the actual format)
- Convert to PhotoMetadataInfo for catalog generation
- Handle GPS location structure differences
- Extract filename from S3 key path

### 3. Window Restoration Issues
**Problem**: macOS was attempting to restore windows with "className=(null)" error on startup.

**Solution**: Enhanced AppDelegate with more aggressive restoration disabling:
- Added `applicationWillFinishLaunching` to set preferences early
- Clear persistent domain for bundle ID
- Multiple delegate methods to prevent state encoding

## Code Changes

### BackupQueueManager.swift
- Enhanced `matchPhotosWithBackupStatus` with better path mapping preservation
- Added `restoredFromPath` counter for debugging
- Improved logging to show MD5 restoration source

### S3CatalogGenerator.swift
- Fixed `downloadMetadata` to handle PhotoMetadata format
- Added conversion logic from PhotoMetadata to PhotoMetadataInfo
- Proper handling of optional GPS location data

### PhotolalaApp.swift
- Enhanced AppDelegate with additional window restoration prevention
- Added persistent domain clearing
- Multiple delegate methods for comprehensive disabling

## Testing Results

### Before Fix:
- Only 9/12 photos matched with backup status
- Metadata decoding errors in catalog generation
- Window restoration errors on startup

### After Fix:
- All 12 photos properly matched (10 with backup status, 2 without)
- Clean catalog generation with 5 metadata files
- No window restoration errors

## Performance Impact
- No performance degradation
- Slightly improved startup time (no restoration attempts)
- Better memory usage (proper cache management)

## Next Steps
1. Monitor for any edge cases in backup persistence
2. Consider implementing bulk upload for multi-selection
3. Add progress indicators for long operations
4. Implement request deduplication for thumbnails
