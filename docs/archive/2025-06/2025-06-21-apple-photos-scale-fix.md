# Apple Photos Scale to Fit/Fill Fix - Session Summary

**Date**: 2025-06-21
**Branch**: feature/apple-photos-browser

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Scale to Fit/Fill Toggle Not Working
**Problem**: The scale to fit/fill toggle button in Apple Photos Library browser changed state but photos didn't visually update.

**Root Cause**: Multiple issues were identified:
- Settings weren't properly bound between views (was passing value instead of binding)
- Apple Photos thumbnails were pre-cropped by Photos API using `.aspectFill`
- `updateVisibleCells()` was calling `configure()` which reloaded thumbnails instead of just updating display mode

**Fix**:
- Changed to use `@Binding` for settings in `UnifiedPhotoCollectionViewRepresentable`
- Changed Photos API request from `.aspectFill` to `.aspectFit` to get uncropped images
- Added `updateDisplayModeOnly()` method to update just the display mode without reloading
- Modified `updateVisibleCells()` to reconfigure cells with new settings

### 2. Thumbnail Clipping Issues
**Problem**: Thumbnails were overflowing their cell bounds, especially in the top-left area of the collection view.

**Root Cause**: `ScalableImageView` only clipped to bounds in `.scaleToFill` mode, not in `.scaleToFit` mode.

**Fix**: Modified `ScalableImageView` to always clip to bounds regardless of scale mode.

### 3. Constraint Conflicts and Non-Square Thumbnails
**Problem**: Thumbnails appeared non-square with constraint warnings in console. Image views were 50% of cell size.

**Root Cause**: Conflicting constraints - image view was constrained to both leading/trailing edges AND fixed width.

**Fix**: 
- Removed leading/trailing constraints
- Used centerX constraint instead
- Added `masksToBounds` to cell's main view

### 4. Thumbnail Size Changes Not Applied
**Problem**: Changing thumbnail size (S/M/L) didn't update existing cells.

**Root Cause**: `updateVisibleCells()` only updated display mode, not cell size constraints.

**Fix**: Modified `updateVisibleCells()` to fully reconfigure cells when settings change, updating both display mode and size constraints.

## Code Changes

### PhotoApple.swift
```swift
// Changed from .aspectFill to .aspectFit to get uncropped images
contentMode: .aspectFit, // was .aspectFill
```

### ThumbnailDisplaySettings.swift
```swift
// Changed default display mode to .scaleToFill for better grid appearance
var displayMode: ThumbnailDisplayMode = .scaleToFill // was .scaleToFit
```

### UnifiedPhotoCell.swift
- Fixed constraint conflicts by centering image view instead of stretching
- Added `updateDisplayModeOnly()` public method
- Added `masksToBounds` to cell view for proper clipping
- Added `layoutSubtreeIfNeeded()` after setting image for immediate layout

### UnifiedPhotoCollectionViewController.swift
- Modified `updateVisibleCells()` to fully reconfigure cells when settings change
- Removed `updateDisplayModeOnly` calls in favor of full reconfiguration

### ScalableImageView.swift
- Modified to always clip to bounds, not just in `.scaleToFill` mode
- Removed debug logging once issues were resolved

### PhotolalaCommands.swift
- Added NavigationStack wrapper to Apple Photos browser window
- Added Apple Photos Library menu item with ⇧⌘L shortcut

### ApplePhotosBrowserView.swift
- Cleaned up redundant settings initialization

## Results

1. ✅ Scale to fit/fill toggle now works correctly in Apple Photos Library
2. ✅ Thumbnails are properly clipped and don't overflow cell bounds
3. ✅ Thumbnails display as proper squares in `.scaleToFill` mode
4. ✅ Thumbnail size changes (S/M/L) are immediately applied
5. ✅ No more constraint conflicts in console

## Architecture Notes

The fix maintains consistency between Directory browser and Apple Photos browser by:
- Using the same `ScalableImageView` component for both
- Applying the same display settings through the unified architecture
- Ensuring both browsers respond to toolbar controls identically

The key insight was that Apple Photos API was providing pre-cropped images, which prevented our UI from controlling the display mode. By requesting uncropped images with `.aspectFit`, we regained control over how images are displayed.
