## Technical Details

### PhotoKit Implementation
```swift
// Authorization
PHPhotoLibrary.requestAuthorization(for: .readWrite) { status in
    // Handle authorization
}

// Album fetching
let fetchOptions = PHFetchOptions()
fetchOptions.sortDescriptors = [NSSortDescriptor(key: "creationDate", ascending: false)]

// Thumbnail loading via PHCachingImageManager
imageManager.requestImage(for: asset, targetSize: targetSize, ...)
```

### Privacy Configuration
Added to project.pbxproj:
```
INFOPLIST_KEY_NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription = "Photolala needs access to your photo library to browse and display your photos.";
```

## Testing Performed

- ✅ macOS build and run
- ✅ iOS build and run
- ✅ Authorization flow
- ✅ Album browsing
- ✅ Photo thumbnail loading
- ✅ Menu functionality
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts

## Known Limitations

1. Read-only access (no editing/deleting)
2. No Live Photos support
3. No burst photo selection
4. Basic metadata only

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

1. Search integration using PhotoKit
2. Live Photos playback
3. Advanced metadata display
4. People/Faces browsing
5. Shared album support

## Conclusion

The Apple Photos Library browser is fully functional and integrated with Photolala's unified browser architecture. Users can now browse their Photos library with the same familiar interface used for local folders and cloud storage.
