# S3 Photo Browser Implementation Plan

## Current Status (Phase 2 Complete - June 18, 2025)

### ✅ Phase 1: S3 Photo Browser (Complete)
- Basic S3 photo browser is functional with catalog-first architecture
- No S3 ListObjects calls - uses local catalog cache
- Thumbnails load from S3 with local caching
- Catalog sync with ETag-based delta updates
- Offline browsing with cached catalog
- Full-size photo viewing with download

### ✅ Phase 2: S3 Backup Service (Complete)
- Testing mode with hardcoded user ID
- Multi-photo upload (up to 10 photos)
- Automatic thumbnail generation during upload
- Catalog generation and synchronization
- Works with both signed-in users and test mode
- Progress indicators and status messages

## Key Implementation Details

### S3 Backup Test View
- **Testing Mode**: Added `isTestingMode` flag with hardcoded `test-s3-user-001`
- **Multi-Photo Selection**: PhotosPicker with `maxSelectionCount: 10`
- **Direct S3 Upload**: Bypasses backup manager when in test mode
- **Automatic Thumbnails**: Generated and uploaded during photo upload
- **Dynamic User ID**: Uses signed-in user ID or test user ID

### Technical Changes
1. **S3BackupTestView.swift**
   - Added testing mode support
   - Implemented multi-photo upload
   - Fixed credential handling for test mode
   - Added thumbnail generation during upload

2. **S3CatalogSyncService.swift**
   - Fixed catalog path from "catalog/" to "catalogs/"
   - Improved atomic updates with unique temp directories
   - Better error handling for sandboxed environment

3. **S3PhotoBrowserView.swift**
   - Removed login requirement for testing
   - Added debug mode for development

## Testing Results
- Successfully uploaded photos with MD5 hashes
- Thumbnails generated and uploaded automatically
- Catalogs created with correct photo entries
- Both test mode and signed-in mode working

## Original Plan (For Reference)

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1) ✅
- Create `.photolala` Catalog System
- Add S3 Catalog Management
- Update Local Browser

### Phase 2: S3 Browser View (Week 2) ✅
- Create Dedicated S3 Browser
- Thumbnail Management
- Photo Detail View

### Phase 3: Polish & Performance (Upcoming)
- Offline Support
- Performance Optimization
- User Experience

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks

## Key Design Decisions Implemented

1. **Catalog-First Architecture**: Successfully implemented - no S3 ListObjects calls
2. **Smart Caching**: Thumbnail cache with local storage
3. **Testing Mode**: Allows development without Apple Sign-in
4. **Multi-Photo Support**: Batch operations for better UX

## Success Metrics Achieved
