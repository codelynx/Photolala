## Archive Strategy Implementation

### Aggressive Archiving Rules
1. **Photos older than 90 days** → Deep Archive
2. **Viewed less than once in 60 days** → Deep Archive
3. **Duplicate photos** → Immediate Deep Archive
4. **RAW files** → Deep Archive after 30 days

### User Experience Optimization
- **Smart Caching**: Keep thumbnails always accessible
- **Predictive Loading**: Pre-retrieve photos near anniversaries
- **Batch Retrieval**: Group archive requests for efficiency
- **Clear Messaging**: "Older photos may take 12 hours to access"

## Cost Optimization Techniques

### 1. Minimize API Calls
- Batch operations (1000 items per call)
- Cache metadata locally
- Use lifecycle policies for automatic transitions

### 2. Smart Storage Classes
```
Age → Storage Class:
0-7 days:     Standard (for deduplication)
7-90 days:    Standard-IA
90+ days:     Deep Archive
```

### 3. Efficient Data Transfer
- Client-side compression before upload
- Multipart uploads for large files
- Direct S3 uploads (bypass server)

## Market Positioning

### Price Comparison
```

- "Save 90% vs iCloud"

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: MVP Launch (Month 1-2)
- Launch with $2.99 tier only
- Test archiving algorithms
- Gather user behavior data

### Phase 2: Tier Expansion (Month 3)
- Add $0.99 and $1.99 tiers
- Refine archive thresholds
- Implement predictive retrieval

### Phase 3: Optimization (Month 4-6)
- A/B test archive timings
- Introduce annual plans (20% discount)
- Add family sharing features

## Risk Mitigation

### 1. Retrieval Cost Spikes
- **Cap**: 1 free retrieval/month, $0.99 per additional
- **Smart Retrieval**: Batch requests, predict needs
- **Education**: Clear expectations about archive access

### 2. Storage Growth
- **Deduplication**: SHA-256 hash matching
- **Compression**: HEIF conversion option
- **Limits**: Fair use policy (10TB max)

### 3. Competition Response
- **Lock-in**: Annual plans with bonus storage
- **Differentiation**: Family features, local+cloud hybrid
- **Speed**: Move fast before others react
