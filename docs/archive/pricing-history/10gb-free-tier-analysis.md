# 10GB Free Tier Deep Analysis

## Executive Summary

A 10GB free tier would make Photolala the most generous photo-only storage service, potentially driving massive user acquisition. At $0.05/user/month cost, it requires only 5-7% conversion to paid tiers to be profitable.

## Cost Analysis

- 0.2GB Standard (14-day buffer): 0.2 × $0.023 = $0.005
- 100MB Thumbnails (~2K photos): 0.1 × $0.023 = $0.002

- If CAC > $5: Revert to 5GB
- Sweet spot: CAC = $3-4

## Risk Mitigation

### Abuse Prevention
1. **Phone Verification**: One account per number
2. **Fair Use**: Max 50GB earned via referrals
3. **Rate Limits**: 1GB/day upload max
