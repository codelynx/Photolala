4. **Stepping Stone**: Natural upgrade from $2.99 Plus

## Positioning in Tier Lineup (v1 - Individual Only)

```
Free:      $0     - 7.5GB  (attract users)
Starter:   $0.99  - 250GB  (casual users)
Essential: $1.99  - 750GB  (regular users)
Plus:      $2.99  - 1.5TB  (power users)
Pro:       $5.99  - 2.5TB  (professionals)

Future (v2):
Family:    $5.99  - 2TB    (5 accounts sharing)
Business:  $9.99  - 5TB    (team features)
```

## Marketing Approach

### For Premium Tier
- "Same storage, premium experience"
- "For photo enthusiasts who want more"
- "AI-powered organization included"
- "Your personal photo assistant"

### Upgrade Triggers
From Plus ($2.99):
- "Tired of waiting 12 hours? Get 3-hour express retrieval"
- "Want AI to organize your 300,000 photos?"
- "Unlock pro features for just $2 more"

## Implementation Priority

Given the current strategy focuses on core tiers, recommend:
1. Launch with existing tiers first
2. Add Premium tier after 6 months
3. Use data to refine feature set
4. Consider $3.99 price point if needed

## Conclusion

At the $5 price point, competing on storage alone isn't viable with Deep Archive. Instead, a **feature-rich Premium tier at $4.99** with enhanced capabilities provides better value and margins. This positions between the Plus tier and Family plan, capturing users who want premium features but don't need family sharing.
