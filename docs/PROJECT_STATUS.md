   - Async/await API with thread safety via DispatchQueue (QoS: .userInitiated)
   - Proper thumbnail generation:
     - Scales shorter side to 256px maintaining aspect ratio
     - Center-crops longer side to max 512px if needed
     - EXIF orientation handling (automatic on macOS, manual on iOS)
   - Disk cache in ~/Library/Caches/Photolala/thumbnails/

   - ~~Created SelectionManager class (per-window)~~ - REMOVED
   - Now uses platform-native selection:
     - iOS: UICollectionView's built-in selection
     - macOS: NSCollectionView's built-in selection
   - Visual feedback implementation:
     - Selected: 3px blue border + light blue background
     - Focus: 2px system focus color border (for keyboard navigation)

     - Cell recycling ensures constant memory usage with large collections
     - Supports 10,000+ photos without performance degradation
   - Created three new components:

     - ThumbnailStripCell: Reusable cells with efficient thumbnail loading
   - Visual design improvements:
     - Selection animation with 1.05x scale and blue border (3px)
     - Regular state with clear border on macOS, white on iOS
     - Smooth 0.2s ease-in-out transitions
     - 2px image inset to ensure borders are visible
   - Performance features:

     - Prefetching support on iOS
     - Limited to 4 concurrent thumbnail loads
     - Integration with PhotoManager's caching system
   - Added prefetchThumbnails() method to PhotoManager
   - Feature flag in PhotoPreviewView allows toggling between implementations
   - Maintains exact visual design while significantly improving performance

### üîß Technical Decisions

1. **NSString for Paths**: User specifically requested NSString for directory paths
2. **Native Collection Views**: Better performance for large collections
3. **Simple Start**: Focus on basic functionality before optimization
4. **Clean Code**: Removed temporary debugging print statements
5. **Per-Window Settings**: Each window has independent display settings for flexibility
6. **Enum-Based Configuration**: ThumbnailOption encapsulates all size-related layout properties
7. **No Window Restoration**: App starts fresh each time for cleaner user experience
8. **Native Collection View Selection**: System-only approach
   - Use platform-native selection APIs exclusively
   - No custom SelectionManager - simpler architecture
   - Selection state maintained by collection views
   - Trade custom behavior for platform consistency
9. **Memory-Aware Caching**: Dynamic cache sizing based on available RAM
10. **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in statistics for optimization feedback
22. **Removed SelectionManager - Switch to System-Native Selection (June 15 - Session 13)**:
   - Completely removed custom SelectionManager class
   - Switched to platform-native selection mechanisms:
     - iOS: UICollectionView's `allowsMultipleSelection` and `indexPathsForSelectedItems`
     - macOS: NSCollectionView's `allowsMultipleSelection` and `selectionIndexPaths`
   - Simplified PhotoCollectionViewController:
     - Removed all selection mode code (iOS now always allows selection)
     - Removed `isSelectionMode`, `enterSelectionMode()`, `exitSelectionMode()`
     - Selection state managed entirely by collection views
     - Added `updateSelectionState()` call in cell's `isSelected` didSet
