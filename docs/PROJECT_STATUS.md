   - Dual caching system: full images by path, thumbnails by content
   - Async/await API with thread safety via DispatchQueue (QoS: .userInitiated)
   - Proper thumbnail generation:
     - Scales shorter side to 256px maintaining aspect ratio
     - Center-crops longer side to max 512px if needed
     - EXIF orientation handling (automatic on macOS, manual on iOS)
   - Disk cache in ~/Library/Caches/Photolala/thumbnails/
   - Cross-platform implementation without priority inversions
   - Collection views now use PhotoManager instead of loading full images

9. **Fixed Thumbnail Generation Issues (June 13 - Session 2)**:

   - Fixed caching to use thumbnailCache instead of imageCache
   - Resolved priority inversion warnings:
     - Set PhotoManager queue to .userInitiated QoS
     - Replaced lockFocus/unlockFocus with Core Graphics on macOS
     - Used NSBitmapImageRep for thread-safe rendering

     - macOS: Relies on NSImage's automatic orientation handling
   - Updated collection view cells to use async/await with PhotoManager

10. **Added Thumbnail Display Options (June 13 - Session 3)**:
   - Created ThumbnailDisplaySettings model:
     - Display modes: Scale to Fit vs Scale to Fill

     - Visible items update display mode immediately
   - Each window maintains independent display settings
   - Cross-platform toolbar implementation in SwiftUI

11. **Enhanced Thumbnail Display System (June 13 - Session 4)**:

   - ~~Created SelectionManager class (per-window)~~ - REMOVED
   - Now uses platform-native selection:

     - macOS: NSCollectionView's built-in selection
   - Visual feedback implementation:
     - Selected: 3px blue border + light blue background
     - Focus: 2px system focus color border (for keyboard navigation)
   - What works (via native collection views):
     - Single click selection
     - Cmd+click toggle selection
     - Shift+click range selection
     - Arrow key navigation

     - Preserves path-to-MD5 mappings across sessions
     - Better logging for debugging state restoration
   - **Implementation Details**:
     - Added restoredFromPath counter for tracking
     - Store MD5s in pathToMD5 even for non-starred photos
     - Save updated mappings after matching operations
     - Clear differentiation in logs between starred/non-starred photos

     - Multiple delegate methods to prevent state encoding
     - Should eliminate restoration errors on launch

39. **S3 Catalog Sync Fix (June 21)**:
   - **Fixed "file exists" error during atomic updates**:
     - Root cause: CacheManager.cloudCatalogURL() auto-creating directories
     - Solution: Create temp directories at user level, not inside .photolala
     - Improved atomic update process with proper backup handling
   - **Directory structure during sync**:
     - Temp download: `{userId}/tmp_{UUID}/.photolala/`
     - Backup location: `{userId}/backup_{UUID}/`
     - Final location: `{userId}/.photolala/`
   - **Result**: Cloud browser now reliably syncs and displays S3 photos

### üîß Recent Bug Fixes

- Thumbnail generation: ~1.6-1.8 seconds per photo
- Memory usage: Capped at 8GB for images, 100MB for thumbnails
- S3 upload speed: Depends on network, typically 2-5 photos/second

### üéØ Next Priority Items

1. Implement bulk operations for multi-selection
2. Add search/filter functionality
3. Implement S3 download/restore features
4. Add progress indication for long operations
5. Create onboarding flow for new users
