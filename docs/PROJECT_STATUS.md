## üìç PROJECT STATUS REPORT

Last Updated: July 30, 2025

### üöÄ Current Status: Multi-Provider Account Linking

The application now supports linking multiple authentication providers (Apple ID and Google) to a single Photolala account. Users can sign in with either provider to access the same photos, subscriptions, and data. The implementation includes complete provider unlinking with S3 cleanup, modern UI design, and fallback authentication methods for enhanced reliability.
