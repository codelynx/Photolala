### üìù Recent Changes (June 15, 2025)

14. **Implemented iOS Selection Mode (June 13 - Session 6)**:
   - Added proper iOS selection mode pattern:
     - "Select" button in navigation bar (via SwiftUI toolbar)
     - Enter/exit selection mode with UI transitions
     - Cancel and Select All buttons replace navigation items
     - Bottom toolbar with Share and Delete actions
   - Visual implementation (refined during session):
     - Initially implemented checkbox overlays (SF Symbols)
     - Changed to border-based selection per user preference:
       - 4px blue border for selected items
       - 15% blue background tint for selected items
       - 1px separator color border for unselected items in selection mode
     - Fixed toolbar background color consistency with safe area:
       - Used UIToolbarAppearance with configureWithOpaqueBackground()

     - Removed iOS focus ring (no keyboard navigation on touch devices)
   - SwiftUI/UIKit integration architecture:
     - Select button placed in PhotoBrowserView's toolbar (not UIViewController)

     - Callbacks: onPhotosLoaded, onSelectionModeChanged
   - Interactions:
     - Tap to toggle selection in selection mode
     - Normal tap navigation disabled during selection
     - Selection count displayed in navigation title
     - Toolbar actions show alerts (placeholder for future implementation)

15. **Implemented Photo Preview/Detail View (June 13 - Session 7)**:

     - Loads full-resolution images with caching via PhotoManager
     - Shows loading indicator and error states
   - Navigation features:
     - If selection exists: navigates only between selected photos
     - If no selection: navigates through all photos in folder
     - Arrow keys (left/right) on macOS
     - Swipe gestures on iOS
     - Previous/Next buttons with visual indicators
   - Zoom and pan functionality:
     - NSScrollView with magnification on macOS

     - Center-crops longer side to max 512px if needed
     - EXIF orientation handling (automatic on macOS, manual on iOS)
   - Disk cache in ~/Library/Caches/Photolala/thumbnails/
   - Cross-platform implementation without priority inversions

     - Display modes: Scale to Fit vs Scale to Fill
     - Predefined sizes: Small (64px), Medium (128px), Large (256px)
     - Per-window settings (not global)
   - Added toolbar controls:
     - Display mode toggle button

     - cornerRadius: 0px (small), 6px (medium), 12px (large)
     - sectionInset: 4px (small), 8px (medium), 12px (large)
   - Simplified settings architecture:
     - Store ThumbnailOption directly instead of CGFloat size
     - Removed unnecessary conversion methods

13. **Implemented Selection System (June 13 - Session 5)**:
   - Created SelectionManager class (per-window):
     - Tracks selectedItems, anchorItem, and focusedItem
     - Methods for single/multi/range selection
     - Designed for keyboard and mouse interactions
   - Visual feedback implementation:
     - Selected: 3px blue border + light blue background
     - Focus: 2px system focus color border (for keyboard navigation)
   - Integration approach simplified:
     - Initially tried custom keyboard/mouse handling
     - Discovered conflict with NSCollectionView's built-in selection
     - Pivoted to using native collection view selection
     - SelectionManager now syncs with collection view state
   - What works (via NSCollectionView):
     - Single click selection
     - Cmd+click toggle selection
     - Shift+click range selection
     - Arrow key navigation
     - Shift+arrow extending selection
   - Trade-offs accepted:
     - Less control over exact selection behavior
     - Some edge cases don't work as originally designed
     - Simpler, more maintainable code
     - Platform-consistent behavior

### üîß Technical Decisions

1. **NSString for Paths**: User specifically requested NSString for directory paths
2. **Native Collection Views**: Better performance for large collections
3. **Simple Start**: Focus on basic functionality before optimization
4. **Clean Code**: Removed temporary debugging print statements
5. **Per-Window Settings**: Each window has independent display settings for flexibility
6. **Enum-Based Configuration**: ThumbnailOption encapsulates all size-related layout properties
7. **No Window Restoration**: App starts fresh each time for cleaner user experience
8. **Native Collection View Selection**: System-only approach
   - Use platform-native selection APIs exclusively
   - No custom SelectionManager - simpler architecture
   - Selection state maintained by collection views
   - Trade custom behavior for platform consistency
9. **Memory-Aware Caching**: Dynamic cache sizing based on available RAM
10. **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in statistics for optimization feedback
22. **Removed SelectionManager - Switch to System-Native Selection (June 15 - Session 13)**:
   - Completely removed custom SelectionManager class
   - Switched to platform-native selection mechanisms:
     - iOS: UICollectionView's `allowsMultipleSelection` and `indexPathsForSelectedItems`
     - macOS: NSCollectionView's `allowsMultipleSelection` and `selectionIndexPaths`
   - Simplified PhotoCollectionViewController:
     - Removed all selection mode code (iOS now always allows selection)
     - Removed `isSelectionMode`, `enterSelectionMode()`, `exitSelectionMode()`
     - Selection state managed entirely by collection views
     - Added `updateSelectionState()` call in cell's `isSelected` didSet
   - Updated PhotoBrowserView:
     - Replaced `selectionManager` with simple `selectedPhotos` array
     - Selection changes communicated via `onSelectionChanged` callback
   - Benefits:
     - Significantly less code to maintain (593 lines removed)
     - Consistent with platform behavior
     - Free keyboard navigation and accessibility support
     - Simpler state management
   - iOS behavior changes:
     - Single tap now selects/deselects (no selection mode needed)
     - Double tap navigates to preview (avoiding conflict with selection)
     - Selection always available, following system convention
   - Fixed iOS selection issues:
     - Selection now preserved during scrolling
     - Collection view layout updates no longer clear selection
     - Cell reuse properly syncs selection state
     - `reloadData()` saves and restores selection
     - `updateCollectionViewLayout()` uses `invalidateLayout()` instead of `reloadData()`
