# Photolala v2 Project Status

## Overview
Photolala v2 is a complete rewrite of the photo management application for Apple platforms (iOS, macOS, iPadOS, visionOS). This document tracks the implementation status and recent changes.

## Current Status (September 23, 2025)

### âœ… Core Features Implemented

#### Navigation & UI
- **iOS Navigation**: NavigationStack-based with proper sheet dismissal handling
- **macOS Window Management**: Window-per-folder architecture with PhotoWindowManager
- **Home Screen**: Unified design with platform-specific navigation patterns
- **Photo Browser**: Native collection views with thumbnail grid display

#### Photo Sources
- **LocalPhotoSource**: Browse local folders with security-scoped access
- **ApplePhotosSource**: Integration with Photos.app library
- **CloudPhotoSource**: S3-based storage (placeholder)

#### Platform Support
- **iOS**: Full navigation with document picker for folder selection
- **macOS**: Multi-window support with NavigationStack in each window
- **Shared**: Common photo browser UI with platform-specific adaptations

### ðŸš§ In Progress
- Cloud photo storage implementation
- Catalog system for fast photo browsing
- Authentication and account management
- Photo upload/backup functionality

### Recent Changes (September 23, 2025)

#### iOS Navigation Fixes
1. **Fixed Infinite Layout Loop**
   - Added width validation in `PhotoCollectionViewController.updateItemSize()`
   - Only invalidates layout when item size actually changes
   - Prevents continuous `viewWillLayoutSubviews` calls

2. **Fixed DocumentManager Crash**
   - Increased navigation delay to 0.5s after document picker dismissal
   - Reordered dismissal and callback to prevent deallocated proxy access
   - Added async dispatch for proper cleanup

3. **Fixed Photo Loading**
   - Added backup trigger in `onAppear` for photo loading
   - Ensures photos load even when `.task` doesn't fire

#### macOS Window Management
1. **Implemented PhotoWindowManager**
   - Singleton class for managing multiple photo browser windows
   - Each folder opens in a new window with NavigationStack
   - Automatic cleanup when windows close
   - Supports Apple Photos Library in separate window

2. **Window Configuration**
   - Minimum size: 600x400
   - Full screen support enabled
   - Unified toolbar style
   - Window title shows folder name

3. **Fixed Collection View Crash**
   - Added validation for zero width during layout
   - Provides default item size fallback
   - Validates calculated size before applying

#### Architecture Improvements
- Removed sheet-based navigation on macOS
- Platform-specific navigation patterns (push for iOS, windows for macOS)
- Better security scope management for document access
- Enhanced error handling and logging throughout

## Architecture

### Navigation Architecture
```
iOS:
  HomeView â†’ NavigationStack â†’ PhotoBrowserView

macOS:
  HomeView â†’ PhotoWindowManager â†’ New Window â†’ NavigationStack â†’ PhotoBrowserView
```

### Key Components
- **PhotoWindowManager** (macOS): Manages multiple browser windows
- **PhotoBrowserEnvironment**: Dependency injection for photo sources
- **PhotoCollectionViewController**: Native collection view implementation
- **DocumentPickerView** (iOS): Proper UIDocumentPickerViewController wrapper

### File Organization
```

  Photolala/
    Views/
      HomeView.swift
      PhotoBrowser/
        PhotoBrowserView.swift
        PhotoCollectionViewController.swift
        PhotoCollectionViewRepresentable.swift
      DocumentPickerView.swift
    Services/
      PhotoWindowManager.swift (macOS)
    Sources/
      LocalPhotoSource.swift
      ApplePhotosSource.swift
    Models/
      PhotoBrowserModels.swift
```

## Known Issues
- Icon rendering errors in debug builds (CoreUI warnings)
- Photos need to be manually triggered to load in some cases
- Cloud photo source not yet implemented

## Next Steps
1. Implement S3-based cloud photo storage
2. Add catalog system for performance with large photo libraries
3. Implement authentication and account management
4. Add photo upload/backup functionality
5. Implement photo metadata viewing and editing

## Testing Notes
- iOS: Tested on iPhone 16 Pro simulator (iOS 18.5)
- macOS: Tested on macOS 14.0+
- Photo loading verified with local folders containing 64+ images
- Multi-window functionality confirmed on macOS
