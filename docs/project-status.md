### üöß In Progress / Placeholder Implementations

1. ~~**Thumbnail Loading**: Currently loads full images (needs optimization)~~ ‚úÖ Fixed
2. **Photo Detail View**: Not yet implemented
3. **Metadata Extraction**: PhotoReference prepared for expansion
4. ~~**Performance Optimization**: No caching or lazy loading yet~~ ‚úÖ Implemented dual caching

### üìù Recent Changes (June 13, 2025)

14. **Implemented iOS Selection Mode (June 13 - Session 6)**:
   - Added proper iOS selection mode pattern:
     - "Select" button in navigation bar (via SwiftUI toolbar)
     - Enter/exit selection mode with UI transitions
     - Cancel and Select All buttons replace navigation items
     - Bottom toolbar with Share and Delete actions
   - Visual implementation (refined during session):
     - Initially implemented checkbox overlays (SF Symbols)
     - Changed to border-based selection per user preference:
       - 4px blue border for selected items
       - 15% blue background tint for selected items
       - 1px separator color border for unselected items in selection mode
     - Fixed toolbar background color consistency with safe area:
       - Used UIToolbarAppearance with configureWithOpaqueBackground()
       - Set explicit backgroundColor to .systemBackground
     - Removed iOS focus ring (no keyboard navigation on touch devices)
   - SwiftUI/UIKit integration architecture:
     - Select button placed in PhotoBrowserView's toolbar (not UIViewController)
     - Bidirectional state binding: isSelectionModeActive, photosCount
     - Callbacks: onPhotosLoaded, onSelectionModeChanged
   - Interactions:
     - Tap to toggle selection in selection mode
     - Normal tap navigation disabled during selection
     - Selection count displayed in navigation title
     - Toolbar actions show alerts (placeholder for future implementation)

### üìù Recent Changes (June 13, 2025)

7. **Cross-Platform Improvements**:
   - Enhanced XPlatform.swift with collection view type aliases
   - Better code reuse between macOS and iOS
   - Unified delegate and data source protocols

8. **Implemented PhotoManager with Complete Thumbnail System (June 13)**:
   - Content-based identification using MD5 digest
   - Dual caching system: full images by path, thumbnails by content
   - Async/await API with thread safety via DispatchQueue (QoS: .userInitiated)
   - Proper thumbnail generation:
     - Scales shorter side to 256px maintaining aspect ratio
     - Center-crops longer side to max 512px if needed
     - EXIF orientation handling (automatic on macOS, manual on iOS)
   - Disk cache in ~/Library/Caches/Photolala/thumbnails/
   - Cross-platform implementation without priority inversions
   - Collection views now use PhotoManager instead of loading full images

9. **Fixed Thumbnail Generation Issues (June 13 - Session 2)**:
   - Fixed incorrect thumbnail URL generation (was adding '#' character)
   - Fixed caching to use thumbnailCache instead of imageCache
   - Resolved priority inversion warnings:
     - Set PhotoManager queue to .userInitiated QoS
     - Replaced lockFocus/unlockFocus with Core Graphics on macOS
     - Used NSBitmapImageRep for thread-safe rendering
   - Added proper EXIF orientation handling:
     - iOS: Normalizes orientation before scaling/cropping
     - macOS: Relies on NSImage's automatic orientation handling
   - Updated collection view cells to use async/await with PhotoManager

10. **Added Thumbnail Display Options (June 13 - Session 3)**:
   - Created ThumbnailDisplaySettings model:
     - Display modes: Scale to Fit vs Scale to Fill
     - Predefined sizes: Small (64px), Medium (128px), Large (256px)
     - Per-window settings (not global)
   - Added toolbar controls:
     - Display mode toggle button
     - Size picker (segmented control on macOS, menu on iOS)
   - Implemented dynamic layout updates:
     - Collection view resizes cells when settings change
     - Visible items update display mode immediately
   - Each window maintains independent display settings
   - Cross-platform toolbar implementation in SwiftUI

11. **Enhanced Thumbnail Display System (June 13 - Session 4)**:
   - Renamed ThumbnailSize to ThumbnailOption for better semantics
   - Added dynamic layout properties to ThumbnailOption:
     - spacing: 2px (small), 4px (medium), 8px (large)
     - cornerRadius: 0px (small), 6px (medium), 12px (large)
     - sectionInset: 4px (small), 8px (medium), 12px (large)
   - Simplified settings architecture:
     - Store ThumbnailOption directly instead of CGFloat size
     - Removed unnecessary conversion methods
     - Added default property (medium) for consistency
   - Visual refinements:
     - Small: Compact grid with no rounded corners
     - Medium: Balanced layout with subtle rounding
     - Large: Spacious layout with prominent rounded corners
   - Added app icon from legacy branch (sunflower image)

12. **Disabled Window Restoration (June 13)**:
   - Added NSApplicationDelegate to control state restoration
   - Implemented applicationSupportsSecureRestorableState returning false
   - Windows no longer automatically restore on app launch
   - Users start with a clean state each time
   - Added Photos library entitlement for future features

13. **Implemented Selection System (June 13 - Session 5)**:
   - Created SelectionManager class (per-window):
     - Tracks selectedItems, anchorItem, and focusedItem
     - Methods for single/multi/range selection
     - Designed for keyboard and mouse interactions
   - Visual feedback implementation:
     - Selected: 3px blue border + light blue background
     - Focus: 2px system focus color border (for keyboard navigation)
   - Integration approach simplified:
     - Initially tried custom keyboard/mouse handling
     - Discovered conflict with NSCollectionView's built-in selection
     - Pivoted to using native collection view selection
     - SelectionManager now syncs with collection view state
   - What works (via NSCollectionView):
     - Single click selection
     - Cmd+click toggle selection
     - Shift+click range selection
     - Arrow key navigation
     - Shift+arrow extending selection
   - Trade-offs accepted:
     - Less control over exact selection behavior
     - Some edge cases don't work as originally designed
     - Simpler, more maintainable code
     - Platform-consistent behavior
