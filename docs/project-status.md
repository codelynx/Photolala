# Photolala Project Status

Last Updated: June 12, 2025

## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Features

#### Core Models
- **PhotoRepresentation**: Lightweight file representation model
  - `directoryPath: NSString` - Directory path 
  - `filename: String` - Filename only
  - Computed properties for `fileURL` and `filePath`
  - Designed for efficient memory usage with large collections

#### Services
- **DirectoryScanner**: Scans directories for image files
  - Supports common image formats (jpg, jpeg, png, heic, heif, tiff, bmp, gif, webp)
  - Creates PhotoRepresentation objects
  - Console logging for debugging
  - Uses NSString for path manipulation (user's choice)

#### UI Components
- **PhotoCollectionViewController**: Native collection view implementation
  - Cross-platform (NSCollectionView on macOS, UICollectionView on iOS)
  - Uses PhotoRepresentation instead of URLs
  - Basic thumbnail loading (placeholder implementation)
  - Supports selection callbacks for photos and folders
  
- **PhotoBrowserView**: SwiftUI wrapper for PhotoCollectionViewController
  - Simple integration point between SwiftUI and native views
  - Displays directory name in navigation title

- **WelcomeView**: Initial app screen
  - Single "Select Folder" button (simplified UI)
  - Shows selected folder information
  - iOS: Automatically navigates to PhotoBrowserView after selection
  - macOS: Opens new window via menu command

#### Platform Features
- **macOS**:
  - Window-per-folder architecture
  - File ‚Üí Open Folder menu command (Cmd+O)
  - No default window on launch
  
- **iOS**: 
  - Document picker for folder selection
  - Automatic navigation to photo browser
  - NavigationStack-based architecture

### üöß In Progress / Placeholder Implementations

1. **Thumbnail Loading**: Currently loads full images (needs optimization)
2. **Photo Detail View**: Not yet implemented
3. **Metadata Extraction**: PhotoRepresentation prepared for expansion
4. **Performance Optimization**: No caching or lazy loading yet

### üìù Recent Changes (June 12, 2025)

1. **Refactored Photo Model**:
   - Removed complex Photo model with SwiftData dependencies
   - Implemented lightweight PhotoRepresentation
   - Separated directory path and filename for efficiency

2. **Implemented DirectoryScanner**:
   - Replaces previous scanning implementations
   - Simple, focused on file discovery
   - Console output for debugging

3. **Updated Collection Views**:
   - Migrated from URL arrays to PhotoRepresentation arrays
   - Fixed type mismatches throughout the codebase
   - Maintained platform-specific implementations

4. **Simplified Navigation**:
   - Removed PhotoNavigationView (was causing build issues)
   - PhotoBrowserView now uses PhotoCollectionView directly
   - Cleaner architecture with fewer intermediate layers

5. **UI Cleanup**:
   - Removed "View Sample Photos" button
   - Removed "Test Resources" button
   - Focused on core folder browsing functionality

6. **iOS Navigation Enhancement**:
   - Added automatic navigation after folder selection
   - Better user experience - no extra tap needed

### üêõ Known Issues

1. Thumbnail loading is inefficient (loads full images)
2. No image caching mechanism
3. No metadata display
4. No photo detail view implementation
5. No error handling for invalid image files

### üéØ Next Steps

1. **Implement Proper Thumbnail System**:
   - Generate actual thumbnails
   - Add caching mechanism
   - Implement lazy loading

2. **Add Photo Detail View**:
   - Full-size image display
   - Zoom functionality
   - Basic metadata display

3. **Enhance PhotoRepresentation**:
   - Add file size property
   - Add creation date
   - Add basic EXIF data

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement virtualized scrolling
   - Add memory management
   - Background queue for scanning

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Handle corrupted images
   - Handle access permissions
   - User-friendly error messages

### üíª Build Status

- ‚úÖ macOS: Building successfully
- ‚úÖ iOS: Building successfully  
- ‚ùì tvOS: Not tested recently

### üìÅ File Structure Changes

**Added:**
- `photolala/Models/PhotoRepresentation.swift`
- `photolala/Services/DirectoryScanner.swift`
- `docs/project-status.md` (this file)

**Removed:**
- `photolala/Views/PhotoNavigationView.swift`
- Various test/sample code

**Modified:**
- `photolala/Views/PhotoCollectionViewController.swift` - Uses PhotoRepresentation
- `photolala/Views/PhotoBrowserView.swift` - Simplified implementation
- `photolala/Views/WelcomeView.swift` - Removed test buttons, added iOS auto-navigation
- `photolala/photolalaApp.swift` - Uses PhotoBrowserView directly

### üîß Technical Decisions

1. **NSString for Paths**: User specifically requested NSString for directory paths
2. **Native Collection Views**: Better performance for large collections
3. **Simple Start**: Focus on basic functionality before optimization
4. **Console Logging**: Temporary debugging aid, will be removed later
