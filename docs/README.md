## About This Structure

This documentation is organized to separate:
- **Current state** - What's actually implemented and how it works today
- **History** - Design decisions, discussions, and implementation journey
- **Planning** - Future features and roadmap (when needed)

This makes it easy for:
- New developers to understand the current system
- Team members to reference historical decisions
- Everyone to track what's been implemented vs. planned

## Contributing

When adding documentation:
1. **Current features** â†’ Add to `current/` or update existing docs
2. **Design proposals** â†’ Start in `planning/`, move to `history/` after implementation
3. **Implementation notes** â†’ Add to `history/implementation-notes/`
4. **Status updates** â†’ Update `PROJECT_STATUS.md`
