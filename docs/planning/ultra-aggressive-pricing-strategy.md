# Ultra-Aggressive Pricing Strategy - Immediate Deep Archive

## Executive Summary

By sending ALL photos directly to Deep Archive (except for a 14-day buffer in Standard storage), we can achieve unprecedented pricing with 20-30% profit margins. Only thumbnails and metadata remain in Standard storage for instant access.

## Core Strategy

### Storage Architecture
1. **New uploads**: 14 days in S3 Standard → Deep Archive
2. **Thumbnails**: Always in S3 Standard (instant access)
3. **Metadata**: Always in S3 Standard (instant access)
4. **Original photos**: 99%+ in Deep Archive

### User Experience
- Thumbnails always load instantly
- Metadata (dates, albums) always available
- Full photos require 12-hour retrieval (except recent 14 days)
- Smart pre-retrieval for predicted access

Profit: $2.09 - $1.61 = $0.48 (23% margin) ✅
```

## Implementation Details

### Upload Flow
```
1. User uploads photo
2. Generate thumbnail → S3 Standard
3. Extract metadata → S3 Standard  
4. Store original → S3 Standard (with 14-day lifecycle)
5. After 14 days → Automatic transition to Deep Archive
```

### Retrieval Flow
```
1. User browses: Show thumbnails (instant)
2. User taps photo:
   - If < 14 days old: Instant display
   - If > 14 days old: "Photo archived - tap to retrieve"
3. Retrieval initiated: 
   - Show progress indicator
   - Notify when ready (12 hours)
   - Cache for 7 days after retrieval
```

### Cost Optimizations

#### 1. Lifecycle Configuration
```xml
<LifecycleConfiguration>
  <Rule>
    <ID>ArchivePhotos</ID>
    <Status>Enabled</Status>
    <Transition>
      <Days>14</Days>
      <StorageClass>DEEP_ARCHIVE</StorageClass>
    </Transition>
  </Rule>
</LifecycleConfiguration>
```

#### 2. Thumbnail Strategy
- Generate once on upload
- Single size: 256px short side, max 512px long side
- JPEG quality 80% (0.8 compression)
- ~15-20KB average per thumbnail

#### 3. Metadata Efficiency
- JSON format, gzipped
- Include: date, location, camera info, faces
- ~1KB per photo
- Stored in S3 with instant access
