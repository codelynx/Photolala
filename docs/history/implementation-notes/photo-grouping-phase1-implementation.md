# Photo Grouping Phase 1 Implementation

Date: June 15, 2025

## Overview

Implemented Phase 1 of the photo grouping feature, which allows users to organize photos by time periods (Year, Month, Day) using file system dates. This provides instant performance without the need for EXIF data extraction.

## Implementation Details

### 1. New Models

**PhotoGroupingOption.swift**
- Enum with options: none, year, month, day
- Each option has an associated system image icon
- CaseIterable for easy UI population

**PhotoGroup.swift**
- Model representing a group of photos
- Properties: title, photos array, dateRepresentative
- Used by collection view for section-based display

### 2. Core Changes

**PhotoReference.swift**
- Changed from `fileModificationDate` to `fileCreationDate`
- Creation date is closer to when photo was actually taken
- Lazy loading of file dates to prevent blocking during scanning
- Added `loadFileCreationDateIfNeeded()` method

**PhotoManager.swift**
- Added `groupPhotos(_:by:)` method
- Uses Swift's `Dictionary(grouping:)` for efficient grouping
- Groups sorted by date (newest first)
- Handles date formatting for group titles

**ThumbnailDisplaySettings.swift**
- Added `groupingOption` property
- Per-window setting (not global)

### 3. UI Implementation

**PhotoBrowserView.swift**
- Added grouping menu to toolbar
- Platform-specific: Menu on iOS, Picker on macOS
- Icons for each grouping option
- Updates collection view when option changes

**PhotoCollectionViewController.swift**
- Refactored to support multiple sections
- Changed from single `photos` array to `photoGroups` array
- Updated all data source methods for sections
- Selection handling works across sections

**PhotoGroupHeaderView.swift**
- Cross-platform section header implementation
- NSView with NSCollectionViewElement on macOS
- UICollectionReusableView on iOS
- Shows group titles with consistent styling

### 4. Performance Optimizations

**DirectoryScanner.swift**
- Added progress logging for large directories
- No longer loads file dates during scanning

**PhotoReference.swift**
- File dates loaded on-demand, not during init
- Prevents hanging on slow network drives
- Timeout protection for file attribute access

### 5. Bug Fixes

**ClickedCollectionView.swift**
- Added platform conditionals to prevent iOS build errors

**PhotoCollectionViewController.swift**
- Fixed iOS header width (was 0, now uses collection view width)
- Fixed macOS header registration (register view, not item)

**PhotoPreviewView.swift**
- Updated to use fileCreationDate instead of fileModificationDate

## Testing

Created test photos with various dates using `scripts/create-test-photos.sh`:
- Photos from 2023
- Photos from January 2024
- Photos from March 2024
- Photos from June 2025

Verified grouping works correctly with different options.

## Known Limitations

1. Uses file system dates only (no EXIF extraction)
2. Date might not reflect actual photo taken date for edited/copied files
3. No caching of group information
4. Headers don't collapse/expand

## Future Enhancements (Phase 2+)

1. EXIF-based grouping for accurate photo dates
2. Hybrid approach with progressive enhancement
3. Collapsible sections
4. Group by location, camera, etc.
5. Performance optimization for very large collections

## User Experience

- Instant grouping with no wait time
- Smooth transitions when changing grouping options
- Section headers clearly identify groups
- Works seamlessly with existing features (selection, preview, etc.)
