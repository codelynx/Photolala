# Thumbnail Loading and Display Fixes

Date: June 19, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Placeholder Icons Too Prominent
- **Problem**: The "photo" placeholder icon was too black and stood out too much
- **Solution**: Implemented a separate placeholder image view with:
  - 50% size of the thumbnail cell
  - Subtle tertiaryLabelColor tinting
  - Proper show/hide behavior when thumbnails load

### 2. Thumbnails Not Loading on Initial Display
- **Problem**: Thumbnails showed "No thumbnail available" until user scrolled
- **Symptom**: Tasks were being cancelled before completion
- **Root Cause**: `loadPhotoData()` was returning early if already loading, causing concurrent requests to fail
- **Solution**: Implemented proper concurrent loading handling:
  - Added `loadingTask` property to track active loading operation
  - Concurrent calls now wait for the existing task instead of returning early
  - Ensures thumbnails load on first appearance

### 3. Unnecessary S3 API Requests
- **Problem**: Local photo browser was making S3 API requests to check archive status
- **Solution**: Removed `loadArchiveStatus` call from PhotoBrowserView for local photos
- Archive status is only relevant for photos already in S3

### 4. Item Info Bar Visibility
- **Problem**: Item info (filename) bar wasn't properly toggling on iOS
- **Solution**: Added `titleLabel.isHidden = !settings.showItemInfo` to iOS cell configuration

## Implementation Details

### UnifiedPhotoCell Changes

Added separate placeholder image view:
```swift
private var placeholderImageView: NSImageView! // macOS
private var placeholderImageView: UIImageView! // iOS
```

Placeholder configuration:
- Centered in photo image view
- 50% width and height of photo view
- Uses "photo" SF Symbol with tertiaryLabelColor
- Shows error icon ("exclamationmark.triangle") on load failure

### PhotoFile Changes

Improved concurrent loading handling:
```swift
private var loadingTask: Task<Void, Error>?

func loadPhotoData() async throws {
    // If already loading, wait for the existing task
    if let existingTask = loadingTask {
        try await existingTask.value
        return
    }
    
    // Create new loading task if needed
    let task = Task { /* loading logic */ }
    self.loadingTask = task
    try await task.value
    self.loadingTask = nil
}
```

### PhotoItem Changes

Simplified loadThumbnail to always call loadPhotoData:
```swift
func loadThumbnail() async throws -> XImage? {
    try await loadPhotoData()  // No longer checks if thumbnail is nil
    return thumbnail
}
```

## Testing Results

All issues resolved:
1. ✅ Placeholder icons are subtle and appropriately sized
2. ✅ Thumbnails load immediately on first display
3. ✅ No S3 API requests when browsing local directories
4. ✅ Refresh button correctly picks up added/removed files
5. ✅ Item info bar toggles properly on all platforms

## Performance Impact

- Reduced unnecessary network requests
- Improved perceived performance (no blank thumbnails)
- Better handling of concurrent thumbnail requests
- More efficient cell reuse with proper placeholder management
