# Phase 2 Testing - PhotoProvider Capabilities

## Test Date: 2025-06-21

### 1. Verify Capabilities Declaration

#### EnhancedLocalPhotoProvider
- [ ] Check capabilities include: hierarchicalNavigation, backup, sorting, grouping, preview, star
- [ ] Verify supportsGrouping = true
- [ ] Verify supportsSorting = true

#### S3PhotoProvider
- [ ] Check capabilities include: download, search
- [ ] Verify supportsGrouping = true (default)
- [ ] Verify supportsSorting = true (default)

### 2. Test Capability-Based UI Adaptation

#### PhotoBrowserView (Local)
- [ ] Sort picker appears (has .sorting capability)
- [ ] Group picker appears (has .grouping capability)
- [ ] Backup button appears for selected photos (has .backup capability)
- [ ] Star toggle in inspector works (has .star capability)

#### S3PhotoBrowserView (Cloud)
- [ ] Sort picker does NOT appear (no .sorting capability)
- [ ] Group picker does NOT appear (no .grouping capability)
- [ ] Download functionality available (has .download capability)
- [ ] No star toggle in inspector (no .star capability)

### 3. Test Common Toolbar Functionality

- [ ] Both browsers show identical core toolbar items
- [ ] Display mode toggle works in both
- [ ] Item info toggle works in both
- [ ] Size picker works in both
- [ ] Refresh button works in both
- [ ] Inspector button works in both

### 4. Progress Tracking (Future)

Currently using default implementations:
- [ ] loadingProgress returns 0.0
- [ ] loadingStatusText returns "Loading..."

### 5. Code Quality Checks

- [ ] No runtime crashes
- [ ] No type casting errors
- [ ] No performance degradation
- [ ] Console logs are clean

## Test Results

### Build Status
- Compilation: âœ… Success
- Warnings: Some Swift 6 warnings (MainActor isolation)

### Runtime Testing
- PhotoBrowserView: 
- S3PhotoBrowserView: 
- Inspector functionality: 

### Capabilities System
- Declaration: Working correctly
- UI adaptation: Currently manual (future: automatic based on capabilities)

## Summary

The capabilities system is in place and ready for future use. Currently, the UI doesn't automatically adapt based on capabilities - each browser still manually defines its toolbar. This is intentional for Phase 2.

Phase 3 (UnifiedPhotoBrowser) would use these capabilities to automatically show/hide features.
